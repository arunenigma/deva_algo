<xml>INTRODUCTION</xml>
<xml>Genesis of the Vedas.</xml>
<xml>Vcdas are che Word of God, revealed in the beginning of creation</xml>
<xml>for the moral, spiritual and physical guidance and uplift of humanity.</xml>
<xml>They are replete with eternal truths and throw a flood of light on the</xml>
<xml>various aspects of life to make a man perfect and ideal. God out of His</xml>
<xml>infinite source of knowledge reveals in the beginning of creation a</xml>
<xml>part of it adequate for the requirements of the soul, its spiritual satis-</xml>
<xml>faction, fulfilment of its thirst for truth and making its journey of life</xml>
<xml>successful.</xml>
<xml>God is infinite, the soul is finite. The finite soul cannot contain the</xml>
<xml>infinite knowledge of God, God creates, sustains and dissolves the world.</xml>
<xml>Whenever the world is created God reveals the Vedas. This processes</xml>
<xml>going on since eternity and will go on for ever.</xml>
<xml>Rig Veda Mandal 10, Sukta 90, Mantra 9 ; Yajurveda chapter 31,</xml>
<xml>verse 7 ; Atharva Veda Kand 10, Sutta 7, Mantra 20 speak of the revela-</xml>
<xml>tion of the four Vedas Rig, Yajur, Sama and Atharva.</xml>
<xml>Swami Dayananda,whose commentary I have mainly followed in my</xml>
<xml>translation, has discussed the subject more thoroughly in his Introduction</xml>
<xml>to the translation of the Vedas.</xml>
<xml>Maharshi Patanjali writes in the Mahabhashya, that there are 101</xml>
<xml>Shakhas (schools of thought) of the Yajurveda. All of these commentaries</xml>
<xml>are not available at present except the Kanva, Madhyandini, Taitriya,</xml>
<xml>Maitrayani, Kathak, and Kapishthal. On this point Maharshi Dayananda</xml>
<xml>agrees with Patanjali.</xml>
<xml>/There are 20380 verses in all the four Vedas, as given below :</xml>
<xml>( Rig Veda 10522</xml>
<xml>Yajur Veda 2006</xml>
<xml>Sam Veda 1875</xml>
<xml>Atharva Veda 5977 )</xml>
<xml>There was a time when the learned Pundits memorised one or more</xml>
<xml>Vedas, could recite or reproduce them from memory, but alas this system</xml>
<xml>is no longer in vogue due to lack of public and state patronage.</xml>
<xml>The names of the Rishis attached to the Mantras are the names *6f</xml>
<xml>those research scholars and seers, who expounded the meanings of the</xml>
<xml>2 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>verses and commented upon them. They are not the authors or writers</xml>
<xml>of those verses as the western scholars say. Devata is the subject matter</xml>
<xml>of a verse, the topic discussed in it. All good men and beneficent forces</xml>
<xml>of nature like air, fire, water, electricity, months, sun, moon, breaths,</xml>
<xml>lightning, father, mother, teacher, preacher, and soul, which are bene-</xml>
<xml>ficial to humanity are called devatas. They are not all living, personified</xml>
<xml>beings as some erroneously believe them to be.</xml>
<xml>( For correct interpretation of the Vedas, the words should be taken</xml>
<xml>in their derivative, analytical sense, i.e., root-meanings should be given</xml>
<xml>to the Vedic words, and not the traditional, customary, conventional, and</xml>
<xml>generally accepted ones. ^ The word gft<? in the conventional sense is</xml>
<xml>faeces, whereas in the Veda it signifies water. The Brahmanas and</xml>
<xml>Upanishadas do not form a part of the Veda. They are compositions of</xml>
<xml>man of a much later date. The Veda contains only the ^ftctt (the real</xml>
<xml>text of the Vedas) as revealed by God in the beginning of Creation on</xml>
<xml>Agni, Vayu, Aditya and Angiras, the four Rishis most competent to</xml>
<xml>receive God's Revelation.</xml>
<xml>' The teachings of the Vedas are universal^ Yajurveda 26-2 clearly</xml>
<xml>enjoins all learned persons to preach the Vedic truths to all, the</xml>
<xml>Brahmanas, the Kshatriyas, the Vaishyas, the Shudras, the Chandalas, the</xml>
<xml>degraded and the forlorn. Dwijas, the twice-born alone are not entitled</xml>
<xml>to study the Vedas. The shudras and even women are equally entitled to</xml>
<xml>read the Vedas. Persons like Kavish Aylush (the seer of R. V. X, 30) a</xml>
<xml>Shudra by birth, vide Aitareya Brahmana 11-19 and women like Lopa</xml>
<xml>Mudra were the seers of the meanings of Vedic texts and their names</xml>
<xml>are from times immemorial attached to the Vedic verses. God is not</xml>
<xml>expected to be partial to one portion of mankind, and antagonistic to the</xml>
<xml>other by depriving them of their birth-right to study the Veda. In the</xml>
<xml>eyes of God all men, high or low, are equally entitled to God's gifts and</xml>
<xml>bounties, say air, water, sunshine and His Knowledge. In the Vedic</xml>
<xml>church none is religiously great or small. All are brothers who should</xml>
<xml>co-operate to conduce to the prosperity and amelioration of mankind.</xml>
<xml>\AccordingtoSwami Bhoomananda Saraswati, the Vedic seer is a</xml>
<xml>poet and prophet but his poetry is not imaginary and his prophecy is not</xml>
<xml>a mystery unless by that term we mean something beyond our compre-</xml>
<xml>hension and not something entirely opposed to the order of Nature?</xml>
<xml>A seer of 'second sight 1 in the spiritist parlance is not a Vedic</xml>
<xml>seer or Rishi. A person who voices out a number of incoherent state-</xml>
<xml>ments void of any clear, rational significance like the "Revelation" of</xml>
<xml>fohn in the New Testament is also no Rishi. fA Vedic seer is the</xml>
<xml>INTRODUCTION 3</xml>
<xml>inspired recipient or medium of Divine Revelation a person who, by bis</xml>
<xml>righteous, pure and holy life is able to grasp higher and Divine things</xml>
<xml>which are far above the Ken of the generality of mankind. Sir Oliver</xml>
<xml>Lodge calls such seers as 'peaks of humanity.' )</xml>
<xml>Aravinda Ghosha on Swami Dayananda and</xml>
<xml>his Vedic interpretation.</xml>
<xml>Among the great company of remarkable figures that will appear</xml>
<xml>to the eye of posterity at the head of the Indian Ranaissance, one stands</xml>
<xml>out by himself with peculiar and solitary distinctness, one unique in his</xml>
<xml>type as he is unique in his work- Such is the impression created on my</xml>
<xml>mind by Dayananda.</xml>
<xml>It was Kathiawar that gave birth to this puissant renovator and</xml>
<xml>new-creator. And something of the very soul and temperament of that</xml>
<xml>particular land entered into his spirit, something of that humanity which</xml>
<xml>seems to be made of the virgin and unspoilt stuff of Nature, fair and</xml>
<xml>robust in body, instinct with a fresh and primal vigour, crude but in</xml>
<xml>a developed nature capable of becoming a great force of genial creation.</xml>
<xml>When I seek to give an account to myself of my sentiment and put</xml>
<xml>into precise form the impression, I have received, I find myself starting</xml>
<xml>from two great characteristics of this man's life and work which mark</xml>
<xml>him off from his contemporaries and compeers. Other great Indians</xml>
<xml>have helped to make India of today by a sort of self-pouring into the</xml>
<xml>psychological material of the race, a spiritual infusion of themselves into</xml>
<xml>the fluent and indeterminate mass which will one day settle into consis-</xml>
<xml>tency and appear as a great formal birth of Nature. One remembers</xml>
<xml>them as great souls and great influences who live on in the soul of India.</xml>
<xml>They are in us and we would not be what we are without them. But of</xml>
<xml>no precise form can we say that this was what the man meant, still less</xml>
<xml>that this form was the very body of that spirit.</xml>
<xml>The example of Mahadeva Govinda Ranade presents itself to my</xml>
<xml>mind as the very type of this peculiar action so necessary to a period</xml>
<xml>of large and complex formation. Vivekananda was a soul of puissance</xml>
<xml>if ever there was one, a very lion among men, but the definite work he</xml>
<xml>has left behind is quite incommensurate with our impression of his</xml>
<xml>creative might and energy. So it is with all. Not only are the men</xml>
<xml>greater than their definite works, but their influence is so wide and</xml>
<xml>formless that it has little relation of any formal work that they have left</xml>
<xml>behind them.</xml>
<xml>Very different was the manner of working of Dayananda. Here</xml>
<xml>4 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>was one who did not infuse himself informally into the indeterminate</xml>
<xml>soul of things, but stamped his figure indelibly as in bronze on men and</xml>
<xml>things. Here was one whose formal works are the very children of his</xml>
<xml>spiritual body, children fair and robust and full of vitality, the image of</xml>
<xml>their creator. Here was one who knew definitely and clearly the work</xml>
<xml>he was sent to do, chose his materials, determined his condition with a</xml>
<xml>sovereign clairvoyance of the spirit, and executed his conception with</xml>
<xml>the puissant mastery of the born worker. As I regard the figure of this</xml>
<xml>formidable artisan in God's workshop, images crowd on me which are all</xml>
<xml>of battle and work and conquest and triumphant labour. Here, I say to</xml>
<xml>myself, was a very soldier of Light, a warrior in God's world, a sculptor</xml>
<xml>of men and institutions, a bold and rugged victor of the difficulties</xml>
<xml>which matter presents to spirit. And the whole sums itself up to me in</xml>
<xml>a powerful impression of spiritual practicality. The combination of</xml>
<xml>these two words, usually so divorced from each other in our conceptions,</xml>
<xml>seems to me the very definition of Dayananda.</xml>
<xml>He brings back an old Aryan element into the national character.</xml>
<xml>Dayananda seized on all that entered into him, held it in himself, master-</xml>
<xml>fully shaped into the form that he saw to be right and threw it out again</xml>
<xml>into the forms he saw to be right. That which strikes us in him as militant</xml>
<xml>and aggressive, was apart of his strength of self-definition.</xml>
<xml>He was not only plastic to the great hand of Nature, but asserted</xml>
<xml>his own right and power to use Life and Nature as plastic material. We</xml>
<xml>can imagine his soul crying still to us with our insufficient spring of</xml>
<xml>manhood and action. "Be a thinker but be also a doer ; be a soul, but</xml>
<xml>be also a man ; be servant of God, but be also a master of Nature."</xml>
<xml>In Dayananda's life we see always the puissant jet of this spiritual</xml>
<xml>practicality. A spontaneous power and decisiveness is stamped every-</xml>
<xml>where on his work. And to begin with, what a master-glance of practical</xml>
<xml>intuition was this to go back trenchantly to the very root of Indian life</xml>
<xml>and culture, to derive from the flower of its birth the seed for a radical</xml>
<xml>new birth. And what an act of grandiose intellectual courage to lay hold</xml>
<xml>upon this scripture defaced by ignorant comment and oblivion of its spirit,</xml>
<xml>degraded by misunderstanding to the level of an ancient document of bar-</xml>
<xml>barism and to perceive in it its real worth as a scripture which conceals in</xml>
<xml>itself the deep and energetic spirit of the forefathers who made this</xml>
<xml>country and nation, a scripture of divine Knowledge, divine worship and</xml>
<xml>divine action. I know not whether Dayananda's powerful and original</xml>
<xml>commentary will be widely accepted as the definite* word on the Veda.</xml>
<xml>TJie essential is that he seized justly on the Veda as India's Rock of Ages</xml>
<xml>and had the daring conception to build on what his penetrating glance</xml>
<xml>INTRODUCTION 5</xml>
<xml>perceived in it a whole education of youth, a whole manhood, a whole</xml>
<xml>nationhood. Ramamohan Roy stopped short at the Upanishadas. Dayananda</xml>
<xml>looked beyond and perceived that our true original seed was the Veda.</xml>
<xml>And in the work as in the man we find that faculty of spontaneous</xml>
<xml>definite labour and vigorous formation which proceeds, from an inner</xml>
<xml>principle of perfect clearness, truth and sincerity. To be clear in one's</xml>
<xml>own mind, entirely true and plain with one's self and with others,</xml>
<xml>wholly honest with the conditions and materials of one's labour, is a rare</xml>
<xml>gift in our crooked, complex and faltering humanity. It is the spirit of</xml>
<xml>the Aryan worker and a sure secret of vigorous success. It is good that</xml>
<xml>the spirt of the Master should leave its trace in his followers, ^that some-</xml>
<xml>where in India there should be a body of whom it can be said that when</xml>
<xml>a work is seen to be necessary and right, the men will be forthcoming,</xml>
<xml>the means forthcoming, and that work will surely be done.</xml>
<xml>(Truth^seems a simple thing and is yet most difficult. Truth was</xml>
<xml>the master-word of the Vedic teaching, truth in the soul, truth in</xml>
<xml>vision, truth in the intention, truth in the act.j Practical truth,</xml>
<xml>Aryatva, an inner candour and a strong sincerity, clearness_atyl open</xml>
<xml>honour iii th_e word and deed, was the temperament of the old Aryan</xml>
<xml>morals. This was the stamp that Dayananda left behind him and</xml>
<xml>it should be the mark and effigy of himself by which the parentage of</xml>
<xml>his work can be recognised. May his spirit act in India pure, unspoilt,</xml>
<xml>unmodified and help to give us back that of which our life stands</xml>
<xml>specially in need, pure energy, high clearness, the penetrating eye, the</xml>
<xml>masterful hand, the noble and dominant sincerity.</xml>
<xml>f Dayananda accepted the Veda as the rock of firro^Jjoundation^ he</xml>
<xml>took it for his guiding view of life, his rule of inner existenceanJTiis</xml>
<xml>inspiration for external work, but he regarded it as even more, the</xml>
<xml>word of eternal Truth on which man's knowledge of God and his</xml>
<xml>relations with the Divine Being and with his fellows can be rightly and</xml>
<xml>securely founded,</xml>
<xml>f But among all the materials of our past the Veda is the most</xml>
<xml>venerable and has been directly and indirectly the most potent. Even</xml>
<xml>when its sense was no longer understood, even when its traditions were</xml>
<xml>lost behind Pauranic forms, it was still held in honour, though without</xml>
<xml>knowledge, as authoritative revelation, and inspired Book of Knowledge,</xml>
<xml>the source of all sanctions and standard of all truth.)</xml>
<xml>/ While Western scholarship extending the hints of Sayana seemed</xml>
<xml>to have classed the Veda for ever as a ritual liturgy to Nature Gods, the</xml>
<xml>genius of the race looking through the eyes of Dayananda pierced behind</xml>
<xml>6 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>the error of many centuries and again the intuition of a timeless revelation</xml>
<xml>and a divine truth given to humanity. In any case we have to make one</xml>
<xml>choice or another. Either the Veda is what Sayana says it is, and then</xml>
<xml>we have to leave it behind for ever as the document of a mythology and</xml>
<xml>ritual which have no longer any living truth or force for thinking minds,</xml>
<xml>or it is what the European scholars say it is, and then we have to put</xml>
<xml>it away among the relics of the past as an antique record of semi-</xml>
<xml>barbarous worship or else it is indeed Veda, a book of divine knowledge,</xml>
<xml>and then it becomes of supreme importance to us to know and to hear</xml>
<xml>its message.</xml>
<xml>It is objected to the sense Dayananda gave to the Veda that it is</xml>
<xml>no true sense, but an arbitrary fabrication of imaginative learning and</xml>
<xml>ingenuity, to his method that it is fantastic and unacceptable to the</xml>
<xml>critical reason, to his teaching of a revealed scripture that the very idea</xml>
<xml>is a rejected superstition impossible for any enlightened mind to admit</xml>
<xml>or to announce sincerely. I will not examine the solidity of Dayananda's</xml>
<xml>interpretation of Vedic texts, nor anticipate the verdict of the future</xml>
<xml>on his commentary, nor discuss his theory of revelation. I shall only</xml>
<xml>state his broad principles underlying his thought about the Veda they</xml>
<xml>present themselves to me.</xml>
<xml>To start with the negation of his work by his critics, in whose</xml>
<xml>mouth does it lie to accuse Dayananda's dealings with the Veda of a</xml>
<xml>fantastic or arbitrary ingenuity ? Nor in the mouth of those who accept</xml>
<xml>Sayana's traditional interpretation. For if ever there was a monument of</xml>
<xml>arbitrarily erudite ingenuity, of great learning divorced, as great learn-</xml>
<xml>ing too often is, from sound judgement and sure taste and a faithful</xml>
<xml>critical and comperative observation ; from direct seeing and often even</xml>
<xml>from plainest common sense or of a constant fitting to the text into</xml>
<xml>the Procrustean bed of preconceived theory. It is surely this commentary,</xml>
<xml>otherwise so imposing, so useful as first crude material, so erudite and</xml>
<xml>laborious, left to us by the Acharya Sayana. Nor does the reproach lie</xml>
<xml>in the mouth of those who take as final the recent labours of European</xml>
<xml>scholarship. For if ever there was a tor of interpretation in which the</xml>
<xml>loosest vein has been given to an ingenius speculation, in which doubtful</xml>
<xml>indications have been snatched at as certain proofs, in which the boldest</xml>
<xml>conclusions have been insisted upon with the scantiest justification, the</xml>
<xml>most enormous difficulties ignored and preconceived prejudice main-</xml>
<xml>tained in face of the clear and often admitted suggestions of the text, it</xml>
<xml>is surely this labour, so eminently respectable otherwise for its industry,</xml>
<xml>goodwill and power of research, performed through a long century by</xml>
<xml>European Vedic scholarship,</xml>
<xml>INTRODUCTION</xml>
<xml>1</xml>
<xml>An interpretation of Veda must stand or fall by its central con-</xml>
<xml>ception of the Vedic religion and the amount of support given to it by</xml>
<xml>intrinsic evidence of the Veda itself. Here Dayananda's view is quite</xml>
<xml>clear, its foundation unexpugnable. Vedic hymns are chanted to the One</xml>
<xml>Deity under many names, names which are used and even designed to</xml>
<xml>express His qualities and powers. Was this conception of Dayananda's</xml>
<xml>arbitrary conceit fetched out of his own too ingenius imagination ? Not at</xml>
<xml>all ; it is the explicit statement of the Veda itself ; "One existent sages 11</xml>
<xml>not the ignorant, mind you, but the seers, the men of knowledge,</xml>
<xml>''speak of many ways, as Indra, as Yama, as Matriswan, as Agni." The</xml>
<xml>Vedic Rishis ought surely to have known something about their own</xml>
<xml>religion, more, let us hope than Roth or Max Muller, and this is what</xml>
<xml>they knew.</xml>
<xml>Immediately the whole character of the Veda is fixed in the sense</xml>
<xml>Dayananda gave to it ; the merely ritual, mythological, polytheistic</xml>
<xml>interpretation of Sayana collapses, the merely meteorological and</xml>
<xml>naturalistic European interpretation collapses. We have instead a real</xml>
<xml>scripture, one of the world's sacred books and the divine word of lofty</xml>
<xml>and noble religion.</xml>
<xml>Dayananda asserts the presence of an ethical element, he finds in the</xml>
<xml>Veda the law of life given by God to the human being. And if the Vedic</xml>
<xml>godheads express the powers of a supreme Deity who is Creator, Ruler</xml>
<xml>and Father of the universe then there must inevitably be in the Veda a</xml>
<xml>large part, of cosmology, the Law of creation and cosmos. Dayananda</xml>
<xml>asserts the presence of such a cosmic element, he finds in the Veda the</xml>
<xml>secrets of creation and law of Nature by which the Omniscient governs</xml>
<xml>the world.</xml>
<xml>Neither western scholarship nor ritualistic learning lias succeeded</xml>
<xml>in eliminating the psychological and ethical value of the hymns, but</xml>
<xml>they have both tended in different degrees to minimise it. Western</xml>
<xml>scholars minimise because they feel uneasy whenever ideas that are not</xml>
<xml>primitive seem to insist on their presence in these primeval utterances;</xml>
<xml>they do not hesitate openly to abandon in certain passages interpretations</xml>
<xml>which they adopt in others and which are admittedly necessitated by</xml>
<xml>their own philological and critical reasoning because, if admitted always,</xml>
<xml>they would often involve deep and subtle psychological conceptions</xml>
<xml>which cannot have occurred to primitive minds !(Sayana minimises because</xml>
<xml>his theory of Vedic discipline was not ethical righteousness with a moral</xml>
<xml>and spiritual result but mechanical performance of ritual with a material</xml>
<xml>reward. The Veda is as much and more a book of divine law as Bible or</xml>
<xml>Zoroastrian Avesta. ^</xml>
<xml>8 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>(Dayananda affirms that the truths of modern physical science are</xml>
<xml>discoverable in the hymns/| There is nothing fantastic in Dayananda's</xml>
<xml>idea that Veda contains truth of science as well as truth of religion. I</xml>
<xml>will even add my own conviction that Veda contains the other truths</xml>
<xml>of science the modern world does not at all possess, and in that case</xml>
<xml>Dayananda has rather understated than overstated the depth and range of</xml>
<xml>the Vedic wisdom.^ Objection has also been made to the philological and</xml>
<xml>etymological method by which he arrived at his results, especially in his</xml>
<xml>dealings with the names of god-heads. But this objection, I feel certain</xml>
<xml>is an error. In early language the word was a living thing with essential</xml>
<xml>powers of signification ; its root meanings were remembered because</xml>
<xml>they were still ii) use, its wealth of force was vividly present to the mind</xml>
<xml>of the speaker. ' The Nirukta bears evidence to this capacity and in the</xml>
<xml>Brahmanas and Upanishadas we find the memory of this free and symbolic</xml>
<xml>use of words still subsisting.</xml>
<xml>Interpretation in detail is a work of intelligence and scholarship and</xml>
<xml>in matter of intelligent opinion and scholarship men seem likely to differ</xml>
<xml>to the end of the chapter, but in all the basic principles, in those great</xml>
<xml>and fundamental decisions where the eye of intuition has to aid the</xml>
<xml>workings of the intellect, Dayananda stands justified by the substance</xml>
<xml>of Veda itself, by logic and reason and by our growing knowledge of the</xml>
<xml>past of mankind. The Veda does hymn the one Deity of many names</xml>
<xml>and powers ; it does celebrate the divine Law and man's aspiration to</xml>
<xml>fulfil it ; it does purport to give us the Law of the Cosmos.</xml>
<xml>On the question of revelation I have left n^elf no space to write.</xml>
<xml>Suffice it to say that here too Dayananda was perfectly logical and it is</xml>
<xml>quite grotesque to charge him with insincerity because he held to and</xml>
<xml>proclaimed the doctrine. There are always three fundamental entities</xml>
<xml>which we have to admit and whose relations we have to know if we would</xml>
<xml>understand existence at all, God, Nature and the Soul. If as Dayananda</xml>
<xml>held on strong enough grounds, the Veda reveals to us God, reveals to us</xml>
<xml>the Law of Nature, reveals to us the relations of the soul to God and</xml>
<xml>Nature what is it but a revelation of divine Truth ? And if,</xml>
<xml>as Dayananda held, it reveals them to us with a perfect truth, flawlessly,</xml>
<xml>he might well hold it for an infallible scripture. The rest is a question</xml>
<xml>of the method of revelation, of the divine dealings with our race, of</xml>
<xml>man's psychology and possibilities. Modern thought, affirming Nature</xml>
<xml>and Law but denying God, denied also the possibility of revelation, but</xml>
<xml>so also has it denied many things which a more modern thought is very</xml>
<xml>busy, reaffirming.</xml>
<xml>INTRODUCTION 9</xml>
<xml>We cannot demand of a great mind that it shall make itself a slave</xml>
<xml>to vulgarly received opinion or the transient dogmas of the hour ; the</xml>
<xml>very essence of its greatness is this, that it looks beyond, that it sees</xml>
<xml>deeper.</xml>
<xml>In the matter of Vedic interpretation I am convinced that whatever</xml>
<xml>may be the final complete interpretation, Dayananda will be honoured</xml>
<xml>as the first discoverer of the right clues. Amidst the chaos and</xml>
<xml>obscurity of old ignorance and age-long misunderstanding his was the</xml>
<xml>eye of direct vision that pierced to the truth and fastened on that which</xml>
<xml>was essential. He has found the keys of the doors that time had closed</xml>
<xml>and rent asunder the seals of the imprisoned fountains.</xml>
<xml>History in the Vedas</xml>
<xml>Swami Dayananda does not believe in history in the Vedas. Western</xml>
<xml>scholars like Griffith, Max-Muller, Monier Williams, Macdonnel,</xml>
<xml>Bloomfield, and Eastern scholars like Sayana, Mahidhar, Ubbat and</xml>
<xml>Damodar Satavalekar, believe in history in the Vedas. History in the</xml>
<xml>Vedas militates against its eternity and revelation from God, and reduces</xml>
<xml>it to a man-made composition.</xml>
<xml>The interpretation put by Pandit Satavalekar on the 22nd, 23rd</xml>
<xml>verses of Sukta 28, Mandal 7 of the Rig Veda, clearly shows that he does</xml>
<xml>not believe in the infallibility of the Vedas. Yaska Acharya, the author</xml>
<xml>of the Nirukta does not believe in history in the Vedas, but there were</xml>
<xml>scholars in his time also who believed in history in the Vedas. According</xml>
<xml>to the etymological formation of the Nirukta, all so called historical</xml>
<xml>names denote ordinary things according to the science of rhetoric.</xml>
<xml>In ordinary usage 3T^ Sff fe^ three tenses are used to denote the</xml>
<xml>past. Wherever these tenses are used in the Vedas, the interpreters of</xml>
<xml>history nourish tradition in the Vedas, taking these tenses to denote the</xml>
<xml>past. This is their error.</xml>
<xml>Panini says in his Ashtadhyayi 3p^fe 5J5;OT^ffo: 3-4-6. Kashka</xml>
<xml>interprets it like this. c< spjfa f^t ^13^^^ H^T^J sp^^fsfZ; JR33T:</xml>
<xml>*?^f?cT | M In the Vedas g^SI^fa^ are used in all the three tenses in</xml>
<xml>connection with verbal roots. Taking their use limited only to the past</xml>
<xml>and deduce history therefrom is incorrect. The Vedas are eternal, hence</xml>
<xml>in their sight all tenses are like the ever present, and there arises no</xml>
<xml>question in the Vedas about the past tense. On this support all the</xml>
<xml>tenses generally denoting the past denote ordinarily the present.</xml>
<xml>Similarly the Vedic words being derivatives are not traditional or</xml>
<xml>personal names. Scholars, when they give up grammar and Nirukta, the</xml>
<xml>10 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>two important limbs of Vedic interpretation, begin to import history ill</xml>
<xml>the Vedas, and trace therein the unfounded traditions of Babylonia.</xml>
<xml>Patanjali, the author of Mahabhashya, commenting on this exposition</xml>
<xml>of Kashka, writes that to interpret these three Lakaras as denoting the</xml>
<xml>past tense when used in the Vedas, is contradictory to the science of</xml>
<xml>grammar, their main limb. As long as Panini's Vyakaran is extant, to</xml>
<xml>interpret the Vedic texts as historical, is a clear sacrilege on the Vedic</xml>
<xml>verses.</xml>
<xml>Having failed to understand the derivative significance of Vedic</xml>
<xml>words, scholars have misinterpreted them as names of historical person-</xml>
<xml>ages. Below I give the true significance of certain Vedic words which</xml>
<xml>the commentators, mistaking for historical names, have uselessly</xml>
<xml>attempted to prove history in the Vedas.</xml>
<xml>1. Sita. This word used in the Veda does not signify the wife of</xml>
<xml>Shri Ram Chandra. It means the furrow traced in a field by the plough.</xml>
<xml>2. Babara is not the name of a King or a person. It denotes the air</xml>
<xml>that hums, thunders and flows.</xml>
<xml>3. Sudas is not the name of a king. A charitably disposed person</xml>
<xml>is called Sudas.</xml>
<xml>^l: TOWTfR: T Nirukta 2-25.</xml>
<xml>4. Paijwan is not the name of a King. An individual whose</xml>
<xml>impetuosity is constant, whose speed or force is unending is called</xml>
<xml>Paijwan, vide Nirukta 2-24.</xml>
<xml>5. Devas is not the name of a king. It is the name of a learned</xml>
<xml>priest who officiates at a sacrifice.</xml>
<xml>6. Agu (*rg) does not denote any historical personage. An ignorant</xml>
<xml>person devoid of knowledge and Vedic speech is called AguW^not, 3</xml>
<xml>* Vedic speech.</xml>
<xml>7. Devapi in the Veda is not the name of any historical person.</xml>
<xml>Devapi is a person who admires and befriends the learned. It is also the</xml>
<xml>name of lightning or thunderbolt.</xml>
<xml>8. Shantanu is not the name of a king. According to Yaska, a</xml>
<xml>man of tranquillity with mental peace is called Shantanu. Water is</xml>
<xml>also called Shantanu as it grants peace and conduces to the good of</xml>
<xml>humanity.</xml>
<xml>9. Angiras is not the name of any special person. Blazing fire</xml>
<xml>is called Angiras. God is also called Angiras, as God is Fire ( *rifc )</xml>
<xml>God engulfs the earth as we do the breaths, hence He is Angiras. A</xml>

<xml>10. In the 13th chapter of the Yajur Veda the word Vasishtha</xml>
<xml>occurs in the 54th verse, Bhardwaj in the 55th, Jamdagni in the 56th,</xml>
<xml>Vishvamitra in the 57th, and Vishwakarma in the 58th. Historical</xml>
<xml>school of thought interprets these words as names of Rishis, but the</xml>
<xml>Shatpath Brahman interprets them thus,</xml>
<xml>(a) JTlflft I sffaS 3tfa: I</xml>

<xml>mitra is described as speech, Vishvakarma, the master of all deeds,</xml>
<xml>is spoken of as God, King, Prajapati and household lord.</xml>
<xml>Rishi Yajnavalkya speaks of the right ear as Gautama, and the left</xml>
<xml>ear as Bhardwaj. He describes the right eye as Vishwamitra and the</xml>
<xml>left as Jamdagni, the right nose as Vasishtha and the left as Kashyap.</xml>
<xml>Speech is described as Attri, as food is taken by the tongue. Being the</xml>

<xml>13. Apsara does not denote celestial dancing nymphs. In the</xml>
<xml>Upanishads they are called Pranas. In Shilp Sanghita they mean the</xml>
<xml>China-clay basins. In Astrology they are spoken of as directions and</xml>
<xml>sub-directions. In bacteriology they mean watery germs. In Alchemy</xml>

<xml>15. Sayana considers Bheda, Tritsu, Yamuna, Ajasa, Shigru and Yakshu</xml>
<xml>to be historical names. This is an erroneous view. The right inter-</xml>
<xml>pretation of these words is given below.</xml>
<xml>(1) Bheda : An enemy's emissary who creates parties in the</xml>
<xml>society.</xml>

<xml>(2) Tritsu is a hero who overcomes all afflictions.</xml>
<xml>(3) Yamuna is a ruler, an administrator who maintains law and</xml>

<xml>(5) Shigru .He who possesses beauty, excellence in action.</xml>
<xml>(6) Yakshu : A sacrificer, who performs the Yajna,</xml>
<xml>16. Bharata is he who wants to advance and progress, being well-</xml>
<xml>fed. Bharata, the brother of Shri Ram Chandra has no place in the Veda.</xml>
<xml>Tritsu is he who is thirsty for self-amelioration.</xml>
<xml>Vasishtha is he who is expert in settling his subjects ; or a teacher</xml>
<xml>or preceptor who is most exalted amongst the Vasu Brahmchari disciples</xml>
<xml>of his.</xml>
<xml>Pratrida is he whose ears have been opened by the preceptor</xml>
<xml>through the knowledge of God and the Veda. Bharatas are the disciples</xml>
<xml>who are reared and looked after by their teacher.</xml>
<xml>17. Prashara is not a historical person.</xml>
<xml>A farsightecj learned person, the arrows of whose intellect can</xml>
<xml>reach far and pierce through the subtle topic and unravel the mysteries</xml>
<xml>of Nature is a Prashara. Such calm, judicious, self-abnegating souls, vho</xml>
<xml>abandon the captivating, carnal enjoyments of the world are called</xml>
<xml>Prasharas.</xml>
<xml>18. Saraswati is not the name of river in the Veda. In the</xml>
<xml>Brahman Granthas Saraswati has got thirteen meanings In the</xml>
<xml>Nighantu 57 synonyms have been given for Saraswati. ^T^ S**^cft I STcTo</xml>
<xml>7-5-1-31. Maharshi Dayananda interprets Saraswati as God iut of His</xml>
<xml>one hundred names enumerated in the first chapter of ths Satyartha</xml>
<xml>Prakash. He has interpreted Saraswati as wife while discussing marri-</xml>
<xml>age. In the Rig Veda Mandal 7 Sukta 9 Mantra 5 Swamif Dayananda</xml>
<xml>translates Saraswati as instructive speech. Pt. Satavalfkar agrees</xml>
<xml>with Rishi Dayananda and ^translates araswati as knowledge and</xml>
<xml>learning. \</xml>
<xml>INTRODUCTION 13</xml>
<xml>19. Jamdagni (sjUcf ^rfrf) is the name of blazing fire, and not</xml>
<xml>of a particular person.</xml>
<xml>Rivers in the Veda.</xml>
<xml>In fifteen places in the Rig Veda, there is a mention of seven rivers</xml>
<xml>according to Sayana. He has interpreted them as the names of rivers</xml>
<xml>the Ganges, the Yamuna etc. Pt. Satavalekar has thus nicely inter-</xml>
<xml>preted them.</xml>
<xml>In the centre is the soul force. From that original place there</xml>
<xml>flow seven streams of (1) Egotism (2) Mind (3) Ear (4) Touch (5) Eye</xml>
<xml>(6) Taste (7) Smell. The stream of egotism is flowing in the field of</xml>
<xml>arrogance. The stream of mind waters the field of contemplation. The</xml>
<xml>stream of ear coursing through ears is flowing in the field of words.</xml>
<xml>The stream of touch, through skin is flowing in the field of touch. The</xml>
<xml>stream of eye, through eyesight, is flowing in the field of sight. The</xml>
<xml>stream of taste is flowing from the tongue in the field of relish. Simi-</xml>
<xml>larly the stream of smell is flowing through breath in the nostrils.</xml>
<xml>These seven streams coming out of the soul, in a state of profound</xml>
<xml>sleep gf<T begin to flow inside and are absorbed in the soul. In a wak-</xml>
<xml>ing state, they begin to flow out of the soul and work in the world.</xml>
<xml>These seven streams are the seven Rishis, the seven rays and the seven</xml>
<xml>hands of the soul.</xml>
<xml>Patanjali Rishi puts the following exposition on this subject in the</xml>
<xml>Mahabhashya. Commenting upon the Rig Veda 8, 69, 12 he writes</xml>
<xml>'O Varuna, noble, talented soul thou art Sudeva (5^f) a true divinity,</xml>
<xml>the seven streams, the seven case-terminations (fsRfrfi) are thy seven</xml>
<xml>forces, which flow towards the palate, wherein the tongue speaks.</xml>
<xml>Just as fire shines entering an iron bar through its pores, so do the main</xml>
<xml>breaths come out of the soul through its gates. Like the division of the</xml>
<xml>force of breath, there are in grammar seven case-terminations, which</xml>
<xml>express the significance of words. The same case-terminations, being</xml>
<xml>the seven streams of speech convey knowledge. He who uses them</xml>
<xml>properly is really the knower of speech, Sudeva, a divine deity.</xml>
<xml>In Vedic literature Indra is soul, which makes the seven streams</xml>
<xml>flow. In the Rig Veda 4. 28, 1, it is clearly written, that Indra the soul</xml>
<xml>set in motion the seven streams, i. e., opened the clogged organs of sense.</xml>
<xml>It is clear that in the Veda, the names of so called rivers do not denote</xml>
<xml>any historical or geographical, temporary or transient objects. These</xml>
<xml>names have got spiritual significance. Saraswati is speech. The smell</xml>
<xml>conveying current flowing out of the nostril is the Ganges,</xml>
<xml>14 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>current flowing out of the ear is Yamuna. The organ of touch is</xml>
<xml>Shatadru. The current flowing towards the head is Vipasha. Aravind</xml>
<xml>Ghosh also does not believe in tffi^Rj: to signify geographical non-eternal</xml>
<xml>substances.</xml>
<xml>Rig Veda Mandal 10, Sukta 75, Mantra 5.</xml>
<xml>O Ganga, Yamuna, Saraswati, Shutudri. Parushni enjoy my praise.</xml>
<xml>O Marudvridha along with Asakni, and Arjikiya with Vatista and</xml>
<xml>Sushoma, listen to my praise.</xml>
<xml>Really speaking these are not the names of rivers. In mataphysics</xml>
<xml>they are the names of arteries in the body. They are called tT?t as they</xml>
<xml>(T^%) make sound. Their voice is heard, even when the ears are shut.</xml>
<xml>The real purport of the verse is given below. 'O Ganga, Ida (f^l)</xml>
<xml>artery, O Yamuna, Pingla artery, Shutudri, Parushni Saraswati, i. e.,</xml>
<xml>Sushumna artery, enjoy my praise sung in the verse about the arteries.</xml>
<xml>O Marudvridha, Sushumna, with Asikriya, i.e , Pingla ; O Arjikiya, Ida,</xml>
<xml>with Vitasta the Sushumna listen to my praise.</xml>
<xml>In this connection Maharshi Dayananda writes thus in the Rig Veda</xml>
<xml>Adi Bhashya Bhumika. Ida, Pingla, Sushumna and Kurma arteries are</xml>
<xml>appellations for Ganga, Yamuna etc. In Yoga philosophy these names are</xml>
<xml>used for God as well, Whose contemplation alleviates miseries and</xml>
<xml>grants salvation. These Ida etc. arteries are used for abstraction of the</xml>
<xml>mind and its steadfastness. In this verse there is repetition of God from</xml>
<xml>the previous verse.</xml>
<xml>Shri Pt. Pali Ratna describes Ganga as an artery instrumental in the</xml>
<xml>circulation of blood. Yamuna is the artery which guides the motion of</xml>
<xml>all parts of the body. The weakening of this artery results in paralysis.</xml>
<xml>Saraswati is that artery which brings knowledge. We can call it</xml>
<xml>Sushumna as well. Shutudri is a part of Sushumna which quickly brings</xml>
<xml>knowledge. Purushni is an attery which maintains heat in all parts of</xml>
<xml>the body and helps in the fine blood circulation. Asiknis are ductless</xml>
<xml>glands. Marudvridha is Pran (breath) that strengthens the body.</xml>
<xml>Vitasta is an artery pervading throughout the flesh. Arjikiya or</xml>
<xml>Vipflsh is an artery that works without any restriction.</xml>
<xml>Sushoma is an artery which remains wet.</xml>
<xml>Scholars, by believing in history in the Vedas have undermined their</xml>
<xml>grandeur and put a stain upon them. Rishi Dayananda by refuting the</xml>
<xml>doctrine of history in the Vedas, has established their eternity, and</xml>
<xml>enhanced their excellence.</xml>
<xml>INTRODUCTION 1</xml>
<xml>Scientific Gleamings from the Vedas.</xml>
<xml>Hymn, second of the tenth Kaand of the Atharva Veda, is a basic</xml>
<xml>text on anatomy, vide verses 1, 31, 32, 33. Having failed to understand</xml>
<xml>its main tenor Winternitz in his "History of Indian Literature" in</xml>
<xml>writing about some portions of the Atharva Veda has used language quite</xml>
<xml>unbecoming a scholar. On the basis of human anatomy this hymn</xml>
<xml>(Sukta) teaches great moral and spiritual truths. Similar texts are found</xml>
<xml>in the Yajur Veda (18-8, 12) also where long lists of animals etc. are</xml>
<xml>given for the instruction of humanity.</xml>
<xml>"What is it that has fitted man with two heels, who has padded</xml>
<xml>him with flesh, who has made his two ankles, who has formed his fingers</xml>
<xml>with beautiful joints, who has provided him with his sense organs, who</xml>
<xml>fitted soles to his feer and put firmness in his waist ?</xml>
<xml>Atharva 10-2-1.</xml>
<xml>"There is an impregnable city (in the shape of the human body)</xml>
<xml>with nine portals (with seven apertures in the head and two below) and</xml>
<xml>eight circles in which dwell celestial (very powerful) beings (the mind,</xml>
<xml>the will, the ego, the five senses) and in which there in a golden (very</xml>
<xml>powerful) celestial (advancing towards final beatitude) treasure-chest (the</xml>
<xml>human soul) surrounded by Light (God the self-effulgent)."</xml>
<xml>Atharva 10-2-31.</xml>
<xml>"Possessors of divine knowledge know that most Holy and Powerful</xml>
<xml>Being to be God Almighty Who resides in that treasure-chest with three</xml>
<xml>spokes (birth, name and place) established in three diverse ways (works 5</xml>
<xml>karma, worship of Godupasana and right knowledge of things Jnana)</xml>
<xml>Atharva 10-3-32 "Almighty God has entered from all sides that uncon-</xml>
<xml>quered golden city, lustrous, giving relief from all fatigue, and surrounded</xml>
<xml>by glory from all round" Atharva 10-2-33.</xml>
<xml>(Translation of these Mantras is taken from Swami Bhumananda's</xml>
<xml>Introduction to Ecclesia Divina.)</xml>
<xml>Agriculture and cloth-weaving also are treated of in the Vedas. Shri</xml>
<xml>Aravinda Ghosh, the great Yogi, Rishi and Seer of Pondichery, is of</xml>
<xml>opinion that there are truths of science in the Vedas, which the present</xml>
<xml>science has not yet been able to discover.</xml>
<xml>In the Yajur Veda 22-26 the formation of clouds is discussed. In the</xml>
<xml>Yajur Veda 24-20 six seasons are spoken of. In the Yajur Veda 17-2 the</xml>
<xml>science of Arithmetic is discussed. Digits are numbered from the unit to</xml>
<xml>billions and trillions.</xml>
<xml>Pt. Guru Dutt Vidyarthi, M.A,, translates Mitra and Varuna, as</xml>
<xml>oxygen and hydrogen, whose synthesis results in water H*O. In the</xml>
<xml>16 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>Yajur Veda, Chapter 33, Verse Seven, there is a mention of aeroplanes,</xml>
<xml>and their non-stop flight for thousands of miles.</xml>
<xml>In Atharva Veda 4-37 and 19-36-6 the words 'Apsaras' and</xml>
<xml>'Gandharva' mean the germs of epidemic disease, which have the power</xml>
<xml>to spread, pervade or get diffused quickly over a wide area. Their forms</xml>
<xml>and shapes, their habitat, are described and herbal remedies to check or</xml>
<xml>forestall their spread, are prescribed.</xml>
<xml>In Atharva Veda 6-111-4 and 6-130-1 Apsaras means vitality,</xml>
<xml>electricity, or energy, and in 6-118-1 it means the sun's rays.</xml>
<xml>In Atharva Veda 2-2-4 the word Gandharva is used to denote the</xml>
<xml>sun. In Atharva Veda 12-1-23 'Ghandharva' means some terrigenous</xml>
<xml>product endowed with fragrance. In Rig Veda 8-77-5 Gandharva means</xml>
<xml>a cloud.</xml>
<xml>There is a mention of Astronomy, Geography, Geology, Hydrostatics,</xml>
<xml>Medicine, and air-flight in the Yajur Veda, Chapter Six, verse twenty</xml>
<xml>one.</xml>
<xml>Schools of Vedic Interpretation.</xml>
<xml>1. The Nairukta. This method was pre-eminently philological</xml>
<xml>as in its attempt to interpret Vedic words it invariably insisted upon</xml>
<xml>enquiring into the origins of Vedic speech. This was the most fastidious,</xml>
<xml>thoroughgoing and perfectly critical method. It has come down to us</xml>
<xml>in Yaska's Nirukta and is known to consist in a full enquiry into the</xml>
<xml>etymology and history of words and expressions it has to interpret. In</xml>
<xml>Vedic interpretation this is the only faultless and at the same time</xml>
<xml>intelligible method. ^</xml>
<xml>2. The Aitihasika or historic method This is the Aitihasika method</xml>
<xml>as Yaska calls it. It consisted in elucidating a Vedic passage by referring</xml>
<xml>particular events in known history. The names of kings and great men</xml>
<xml>in India have, from the earliest ages, conformed to Vedic words. It has</xml>
<xml>never been difficult therefore to find some king, or wise man having a</xml>
<xml>name occurring in one of the four Vedas and their innumerable Schools.</xml>
<xml>Hence it was easy for teachers to refer to events in the lives of such men</xml>
<xml>to illustrate and explain Vedic statements. In course of time, however</xml>
<xml>this method lost its force, as people were thereby, often led astray into,</xml>
<xml>attaching greater importance to the historical illustration than to the</xml>
<xml>Vedic truth itself. The Saayanic commentator has made use of the first</xml>
<xml>as well as the second method.</xml>
<xml>3. The mythological. It was not possible to find historical examples</xml>
<xml>for every Vedic statement, hence to make up for the deficiency, scholars</xml>
<xml>INTRODUCTION 1?</xml>
<xml>Were often led to refer to folklore or to invent stories to exemplify Vedic</xml>
<xml>truths. The available "grand-mothers 1 tales" or "old wives' fables" as</xml>
<xml>they might be called, were collected together and utilised from time to</xml>
<xml>time to explain Vedic statements to the commonalty. Like the historical,</xml>
<xml>this method was very attractive and appealing, but it was more advan-</xml>
<xml>tageous as it hardly left any Vedic statement unillustrated. Besides it</xml>
<xml>was quite easy to frame a tale just at the nick of time to explain things</xml>
<xml>to the audience. Yaaska calls this also as 'itihaasa'. Whenever he criti-</xml>
<xml>cises these or other methods which seem faulty to him, he uses language</xml>
<xml>that very often savours of assent, but it is not so ; he is really criticising</xml>
<xml>the advocates of mythology but his style is so charming and gentle that he</xml>
<xml>often seems to agree with his opponents.</xml>
<xml>4. The scientific. After the Nairukta method this is the most</xml>
<xml>difficult. It consists in identifying Vedic truths with natural phenomena</xml>
<xml>and explaining them as physical-scientific truths. This method though</xml>
<xml>difficult and abstruse is very frequently resorted to by all scholars as in</xml>
<xml>many cases it is the only process that yields the right meaning. Besides</xml>
<xml>there are certain portions in the Vedas which clearly treat of Scientific</xml>
<xml>truths.</xml>
<xml>5. The esoteric or intuitional. This is an extremely abstract and</xml>
<xml>abstruse method of interpretation and is possible only for those who are</xml>
<xml>given to yogic spiritual discipline. It deals with God. the soul, and the</xml>
<xml>human body taking account of the 'outside' world only as an external</xml>
<xml>phenomenon. Yaaska uses this method in the fourteenth chapter of his</xml>
<xml>book. There are some Vedic texts which cannot be explained in any</xml>
<xml>other way but this, e. g.. Rig Veda 10-119. When other methods are</xml>
<xml>employed they yield faulty results.</xml>
<xml>6. The ritualistic method. Perhaps this is the easiest and the</xml>
<xml>most direct way of interpreting Vedic texts. A Vedic passage, for exam-</xml>
<xml>ple, embodies a scientific truth or a prayer to God but at the time of the</xml>
<xml>child's tonsure it is used with reference to the barber or the razor.</xml>
<xml>Here in interpreting the statement it may be supposed, for the time</xml>
<xml>being, to concern only with the barber or the razor, and the vocative,</xml>
<xml>if any rendered accordingly.</xml>
<xml>Of all these methods, it will be seen at a glance, the second histori-</xml>
<xml>cal, the third mythological and the 6th ritualistic are only shabby time-,</xml>
<xml>serving devices and cannot be depended upon. They are, at best, rough</xml>
<xml>processes, intended to bring home to the less deliberative, vedic truths</xml>
<xml>in tentative and attractive, though not enduring and correct forms. The</xml>
<xml>18 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>Saayanic 1 commentator has committed a great fault in utilising these</xml>
<xml>methods in season and out of season to explain the texts of the Rig Veda.</xml>
<xml>Max Midler's Sole Object</xml>
<xml>Max Muller's sole object in pursuing Sanskrit studies as he himself</xml>
<xml>often expressed, was to convert India to Christianity. A letter written</xml>
<xml>to him by E. B. Pussey reads thus : "Your work will form a new era in</xml>
<xml>the efforts for the conversion of India, and Oxford will have reason to be</xml>
<xml>thankful that, by giving you a home, it will have facilitated a work of</xml>
<xml>such primary and lasting importance for the conversion of India, and</xml>
<xml>which by enabling us to compare that early false religion with the true</xml>
<xml>illustrates the more than blessedness of what we enjoy."</xml>
<xml>In 1886 Max Muller thus wrote to his wife : " I hope I shall</xml>
<xml>finish the work, and I feel convinced though I shall not live to see it,</xml>
<xml>yet this edition of mine and the translation of the Veda will hereafter</xml>
<xml>tell to a great extent on the fate of India and on the growth of millions</xml>
<xml>of souls in that country. It is the root of their religion and to show</xml>
<xml>them what the root is, I feel sure, is the only way of uprooting all that</xml>
<xml>has sprung from it during the last three thousand years/'</xml>
<xml>To the then Secretary of State for India, the Duke of Argyle, he</xml>
<xml>writes thus in his letter of 16th December 1868 : " The ancient</xml>
<xml>religion of India is doomed and if Christianity does not step in, whose</xml>
<xml>fault will it be."</xml>
<xml>To Byranjee Malabari Esq., he wrote thus on 29th January 1882 :</xml>
<xml>"As I told you on a former occasion, my thoughts while writing the</xml>
<xml>lectures (the Hibbert) were with the people of India. I wanted to tell</xml>
<xml>to those few at least whom I might hope to reach in English what the true</xml>
<xml>historical value of this ancient religion is, as looked upon, not from an</xml>
<xml>exclusively European or Christian, but from a historical point of view.</xml>
<xml>1 wished to warn against two dangers, that of undervaluing and despising</xml>
<xml>the ancient national religion, a-6 is often done by your half-Europeanised</xml>
<xml>youths and that of overvaluing it and interpreting it as it was never meant</xml>
<xml>to be interpreted, of which you may see a painful source in Dayananda</xml>
<xml>Saraswati's labour on the Veda. Accept the Veda as an ancient historical</xml>
<xml>1. It h a mistake to speak of certain books as the work of Saayana He was not the</xml>
<xml>author of all the work* that go under hn nom-de-plume. Mahaamahopaadhyaaya P. Shivdatta,</xml>
<xml>Shastri, in hi* introduction to the Mahaabhashya mentions the name of 103 works. All</xml>
<xml>these could not have been written by Saayana, especially when we know that the commen-</xml>
<xml>tary on the Rig Veda itself can be a man's life work.</xml>

<xml>ancient and simple-minded race of men, and you will be able to admire</xml>
<xml>it, and to retain some of it, particularly the teachings of the Upanishads</xml>
<xml>even in these modern days. But discover in it "steam engines and</xml>
<xml>electricity and European philosophy and morality," and you deprive it</xml>
<xml>of its true character, you destory its real value, and you break the</xml>
<xml>historical continuity that ought to bind the present with the past.</xml>
<xml>Accept the past as a reality, study it, and try to understand it and you</xml>
<xml>will then have less difficulty in finding the right way towards the</xml>
<xml>future."</xml>
<xml>'Tis pity Max Muller pooh-poohs the eternal truths and teachings,</xml>
<xml>and belittles the etymological and scientific method employed by Rishi</xml>
<xml>Dayananda in interpreting the Vedas, which Max Muller, the follower of</xml>
<xml>Sayana's historical method, hopelessly failed to understand.</xml>
<xml>The following is from a letter to his son :</xml>
<xml>"Would you say that anyone sacred book is superior to all others</xml>
<xml>in the world ? It may sound prejudiced, but, taking all in all, I say the</xml>
<xml>New Testament. After that I should place the Koran, which, in its</xml>
<xml>moral teachings, is hardly more than a later edition of the New</xml>
<xml>Testament. Then \vould follow the Old Testament, the Southern</xml>
<xml>Buddhist Tripitaka, the Taote King of Laotize, the Kings of Confucius,</xml>
<xml>the Veda and the Avesta. There is no doubt, however, that the ethical</xml>
<xml>teaching is far more prominent in the old and New Testament than in</xml>
<xml>any other sacred book. Therein lies the distinctiveness of the Bible.</xml>
<xml>Other sacred books are generally collections of whatever was remembered</xml>
<xml>of ancient times."</xml>
<xml>What a pity Max Muller ranks the Veda as inferior to the Bible</xml>
<xml>and the Koran, whereas in the Lofty ethical teachings these books stand</xml>
<xml>in no comparison with the Veda. To me the disparaging remarks of the</xml>
<xml>scholar are based on ignorance or misunderstanding of the true purport</xml>
<xml>of the Vedas. It would be rather harsh and unjust to say that the</xml>
<xml>scholar has made these remarks intentionally to degrade the Vedas in the</xml>
<xml>eyes of the civilized world.</xml>
<xml>To N. K. Majumr, a Brahmo Samajist, he wrote as follows in 1899 :</xml>
<xml>" You know for how many years I have watched your efforts</xml>
<xml>to purify the popular religion of India and thereby to bring it nearer</xml>
<xml>to the purity and perfection of other religions, particularly of Chris-</xml>
<xml>tianity. The first thing you have to do is to settle how much of your</xml>
<xml>ancient religion you are willing to give up, if not as utterly false, still as</xml>
<xml>20 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>aniquated ; You have given up a great deal, polytheism, idolatry, and</xml>
<xml>your elaborate sacrificial worship.</xml>
<xml>Take then the New Testament and read it for yourselves, and judge</xml>
<xml>for yourselves, whether the words of Christ as contained in it satisfy you</xml>
<xml>or not. Christ comes to you as he comes to us in the only trustworthy</xml>
<xml>records preserved of him in the Gospels. We have not even the right to</xml>
<xml>dictate our interpretation of these Gospels to you, particularly if we</xml>
<xml>consider how differently we interpret them ourselves. If you accept his</xml>
<xml>teachings as there recorded, you are a Christian.</xml>
<xml>Tell me some of your chief difficulties that prevent you and your</xml>
<xml>countrymen from openly following Christ, and when I write to you I shall</xml>
<xml>do my best to explain how I and many who agree with me have met</xml>
<xml>them, and solved them, From my point of view t India, at least the best</xml>
<xml>part of it, is already converted to Christianity. You want no persuasion</xml>
<xml>to become a follower of Christ. Then make up your mind to work for</xml>
<xml>yourselves. The bridge has been built for you by those who came before</xml>
<xml>you. Step boldly forward, it will not break under you, and you will</xml>
<xml>find many friends to welcome you on the other shore, and among them</xml>
<xml>none more delighted than your old friend and fellow labourer, F. Max</xml>
<xml>Muller." (From "Life and Letters of Frederick Max Muller").</xml>
<xml>These letters clearly prove that the real aim of Western scholars,</xml>
<xml>under the garb of research, is to let down the Vedas, and establish the</xml>
<xml>superiority of the Bible. Research scholars in their quest for truth,</xml>
<xml>should proceed without bias, without pre-conceived notions and prejudiced</xml>
<xml>minds. 'Tis pity the Western scholars have miserably failed to follow the</xml>
<xml>requisites of true research, and some of them have in their religious</xml>
<xml>frenzy and bigotry remarked, the Vedas are "mad-man's raving and</xml>
<xml>child's prattle." Their poor knowledge of the Vedic literature, their</xml>
<xml>lack of a thorough unbiassed study of our scriptures, their zealous</xml>
<xml>missionary spirit that blurred their vision, their antipathy towards Non-</xml>
<xml>Christian religions, and their convictions of the superiority of the ethical</xml>
<xml>teachings of the Bible have resulted in arriving at wrong and poor</xml>
<xml>notions of the Vedas, the encyclopaedia of knowledge, and the repository</xml>
<xml>of eternal, lofty, moral teachings.</xml>
<xml>Concluding Remarks</xml>
<xml>Since long I was contemplating to undertake the stupendous task</xml>
<xml>of translating in English the Commentary of Maharshi Dayananda. on the</xml>
<xml>Yajur Veda. My circumstances and multifarious engagements spared</xml>
<xml>me no time for the task. My iron determination and unflagging resolve,</xml>
<xml>INTRODUCTION 21</xml>
<xml>however, helped me in the long run, to fulfil my ambition. Constant</xml>
<xml>labour for some years has enabled me to complete the translation. I am</xml>
<xml>not a scholar, nor do I possess thorough knowledge of Sanskrit. I am a</xml>
<xml>mere devotee of the Vedas. I am a fallible human being and claim no</xml>
<xml>perfection to my work, Errors might have crept into my translation,</xml>
<xml>which, if pointed out by learned scholars, will be acknowledged and</xml>
<xml>rectified in the second edition. The readers should appreciate my</xml>
<xml>sincerity and faith and overlook my shortcomings. I feel obliged to</xml>
<xml>Pt. Jai Dev, Vidya Alankar, and Swami Bhumananda Saraswati, M.A.,</xml>
<xml>whose works I copiously consulted and wherefrom derived help and</xml>
<xml>information. My sincere thanks are due to Shri Dina Nath, B. A.,</xml>
<xml>LL.B., Ex. Public Prosecutor and Ex. Official Receiver, Gurdaspur,</xml>
<xml>who lent me valuable help in going through the manuscript with me,</xml>
<xml>and making useful suggestions for improving the language of this</xml>
<xml>translation. But for this help, the publication of the work would have</xml>

<xml>THE YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER I</xml>
<xml>1. O, Lord, we resort to Thee for the supply of foodstuffs and</xml>
<xml>vigour. May the Creator, the fountain of happiness and knowledge,</xml>
<xml>inspire us for the performance of noblest deeds with our organs. May</xml>
<xml>the cows, which should never be killed, be healthy and strong. For</xml>
<xml>the attainment of prosperity and wealth, may the cows be full of calves,</xml>
<xml>free from consumption and other diseases. Maya thief and a sinner be</xml>
<xml>never born amongst us. May the lord of land and cattle be in constant</xml>
<xml>and full possession of these. May Ye protect the cattle, wealth and</xml>
<xml>progeny of the virtuous soul.</xml>
<xml>2. Yajna acts as purifier, makes explicit, true and perfect knowle-</xml>
<xml>dge, spread in space through the rays of the sun, purifies the air, is the</xml>
<xml>mainstay of the universe, and also adds to our comfort through its</xml>
<xml>exalted office. It behoves us all the learned and their followers not to</xml>
<xml>give up the performance of yajnas.</xml>
<xml>3. The yajna of the Great Lord is the supporter of innumerable</xml>
<xml>worlds and purifies us all. May the Self-Effulgent Lord, lead us aright</xml>
<xml>on the path of virtue. May He purify us through the store of true</xml>
<xml>knowledge and all sciences contained in the Vedas, and elevating selfless</xml>
<xml>deeds. O ye men which branches of true knowledge do ye want to</xml>
<xml>comprehend ?</xml>
<xml>4. Vedas are the true source of knowledge and their study enables</xml>
<xml>us to enjoy the full span of life. They contain the detailed instructions</xml>
<xml>concerning various duties. May we through His grace be firmly con-</xml>
<xml>vinced of the utility of industrial achievements, and may He, the</xml>
<xml>Omnipresent Lord protect our yajnas and the knowledge and means</xml>
<xml>thereof.</xml>
<xml>5. O God, the Lord of Vows, I will observe the vow. May I have</xml>
<xml>strength for that. Pray grant me success in the fulfilment of my vow.</xml>
<xml>I take the vow of renouncing untruth and embracing truth.</xml>
<xml>6. Who prompts you to do good deeds ? It is He, the Great Lord</xml>
<xml>Who guides us on the path of virtue. Why does He do so ? For the</xml>
<xml>performance of noble, virtuous deeds and the fulfilment of the vow of</xml>
<xml>leading a truthful life. The Lord enjoins the workers and their</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER I</xml>
<xml>organisers, the teacher and the taught to be constantly engaged in</xml>
<xml>doing good deeds and achieving fine qualities and true knowledge,</xml>
<xml>7- May we root out the evil tendencies of the wicked, the unsym-</xml>
<xml>pathetic and uncharitable exploiters of humanity. May we take to task</xml>
<xml>the disturbers of peace, and expose the wicked.</xml>
<xml>May we thus get many an opportunity of attaining to prosperity</xml>
<xml>and bliss.</xml>
<xml>8. O Lord, Thou art the dispeller of vices. May Thou punish - the</xml>
<xml>wicked. May Thou deal with the vicious that put the sages to trouble.</xml>
<xml>May Thou inspire the sinful with noble thought, whom we, too, exhort</xml>
<xml>to do noble deeds. We worship Thee, the Giver of happiness and</xml>
<xml>knowledge to the learned, purifier of them, the Promulgator of learning</xml>
<xml>and joy in the universe, and worthy of adoration by the religious minded</xml>
<xml>devotees and the wise.</xml>
<xml>9. O Ye men, increase the store of goods acquired by honest and</xml>
<xml>fair means to be used in the service of humanity. May your life, be</xml>
<xml>constantly dedicated to this principle. May the spiritually minded people,</xml>
<xml>also, not give up this humanitarian work. May your lives be constantly</xml>
<xml>consecrated to the performance of five daily duties. The heat of the</xml>
<xml>sun destroys dirt and odour, and draws substances consigned to fire, in</xml>
<xml>their atomic form for the purification of air.</xml>
<xml>10. In this universe created by the All Effulgent God, I realize</xml>
<xml>the power and influence of the sun and moon, feel the inhalation and</xml>
<xml>exhalation of life-giving breath, appreciate the efforts made by the</xml>
<xml>votaries of knowledge for mastering science of electricity. I follow the</xml>
<xml>researches made by the learned in the applications of water and fire.</xml>
<xml>11. I resort to agriculture and craft for removing poverty and</xml>
<xml>ministering happiness to all. May I feel joy in my domestic life. May</xml>
<xml>our houses be sufficiently commodious, airy, fully comfortable, and built</xml>
<xml>in the middle of an open space. May our life be in conformity with Vedic</xml>
<xml>teachings. O Lord we pray unto Thee to preserve and protect whatever</xml>
<xml>gives us happiness.</xml>
<xml>12. O learned persons, just as in this world created by God, inhal-</xml>
<xml>ing and exhaling breaths are purified by the faultless and pure rays of</xml>
<xml>the sun, just as charming and beautiful waters, which run to the ocean</xml>
<xml>and go up in the atmosphere and nourish medicines are purified by these</xml>
<xml>rays, so do ye perform Homa with pure substances. I always promote</xml>
<xml>this yajna, and sanctify the worshipper with pure mind and strong body,</xml>
<xml>the worshipper full of learning and noble qualities.</xml>
<xml>24 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>13. O performers of yajnas, as the sun receives the aforesaid</xml>
<xml>waters and the air to dispel clouds, and absorbs them for the fast moving</xml>
<xml>clouds, hence ye should always perform yajnas.</xml>
<xml>We all should perform agreeable yajnas, for the attainment of God,</xml>
<xml>for noble acts, for the acquisition of fine virtues and for temporal and</xml>
<xml>spiritual advancement. With the aid of yajnas purify all substances and</xml>
<xml>human beings. Yajnas will remove all your physical and mental defects.</xml>
<xml>I, the Revealer of the Veda, advance this purificatory act of yours.</xml>
<xml>14. May your house be comfortable. It should afford no shelter</xml>
<xml>to the wicked and the uncharitable. May your house serve on as skin of</xml>
<xml>the Earth. May all persons acquire such a house through the grace of</xml>
<xml>God. Clouds receive moisture from forests, reside in the vast space,</xml>
<xml>and receive water from air. May God impart you this knowledge of</xml>
<xml>clouds and building houses. May the learned understand the building</xml>
<xml>of houses, which serve as skin of the earth.</xml>
<xml>15. O yajna, thou art the body of the fire. Thou art performed</xml>
<xml>with the recitation of vedic verses, I perform thee for the acquisition of</xml>
<xml>noble qualities. Thou art a great cloud, the fosterer of herbs, Cleanse</xml>
<xml>this oblation, the assuager of mental pain, for the happiness of the learn-</xml>
<xml>ed Cleanse it well. Those who read and teach the Vedas, become</xml>
<xml>acquainted with the Vedic lore, inspiring us for the performance of yajnas.</xml>
<xml>16. The yajna keeps away the thieves, refines and sweetens the</xml>
<xml>speech, is productive of foodstuffs and is the bestower of knowledge and</xml>
<xml>vigour. Let the performance of such yajnas be inculcated. May we</xml>
<xml>through the aid of heroic persons win battles again and again.</xml>
<xml>The yajna is instrumental in producing rain, may we know thee as</xml>
<xml>rain producer. We should try to efface the dacoits and exploiters of</xml>
<xml>impure minds who lead an impious life.</xml>
<xml>Just as the air with its strong hands of definite motion to and fro</xml>
<xml>receives the oblations and just as the bright Sun full of luminous beams,</xml>
<xml>with his faultless rays resolves into atoms the substances put into the fire,</xml>
<xml>so do God and the scholars preach all sciences for the good of humanity.</xml>
<xml>17. O Lord, dauntless art Thou. Let us avoid in a yajna the use</xml>
<xml>of fire that burns the corpses, and use the fire, that ripens the raw com-</xml>
<xml>modities, and endows us with nobler qualities. Through thy teachings re-</xml>
<xml>move our miseries and confer bliss on us.</xml>
<xml>13. I refers to God.</xml>
<xml>14. Just as skin protects and beautifies the body, so should our houses beautify the plot</xml>
<xml>on which they are built.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER I 25</xml>
<xml>Lord, Thou art the bestower of permanent happiness. May the</xml>
<xml>Earth and the beings living on it advance through high merits. We re-</xml>
<xml>alise in our hearts for the removal of the wicked, Thee who bestoweth</xml>
<xml>happiness upon the learned, the heroic and all sentient beings.</xml>
<xml>18. O 1 Lord, Thou art the sustainer of the universe. Accept our</xml>
<xml>adoration offered through Vedic verses and develop our inexhaustible</xml>
<xml>mental knowledge. For the destruction of internal foes I realise Thee in</xml>
<xml>my heart as the Supporter of the learned, the statesman and the Guide on</xml>
<xml>the path of duty of different classes. Thou art the Supporter of the un-</xml>
<xml>iverse, we pray unto Thee to increase our knowledge. For the destruc-</xml>
<xml>tion of our internal foes, we realise Thee in our hearts as the Supporter of</xml>
<xml>the learned, the statesman and the Guide on the path of duty of different</xml>
<xml>classes. I imbibe in my heart Thee the All pervader, the Giver of happi-</xml>
<xml>ness from all directions.</xml>
<xml>O Ye men, lead a life of penance by controlling your breath, and</xml>
<xml>following the wise, the scientists and the learned.</xml>
<xml>19. The yajna is the giver of happiness, puts an end to the selfish</xml>
<xml>and miserly habits and protects the mid-regions as skin protects the body.</xml>
<xml>May the performer of the yajna realise its significance. The proper reci-</xml>
<xml>tation of the vedic hymns is the yajna in itself. The yajna performed on</xml>
<xml>special occasions also protects the truth as skin protects the body. The</xml>
<xml>yajna is the sustainer of the illustrious sun, the embodiment of Vedic lore.</xml>
<xml>May we realise the yajna as the bringer of rain, and the giver of spiritual</xml>
<xml>knowledge.</xml>
<xml>20. The foodstuffs and water purified by the performance of yajna</xml>
<xml>strengthen the body and sense organs. May we resort to yajna for sound</xml>
<xml>health, for activities, for vitality, for long life full of happiness and pro-</xml>
<xml>sperity. The glorious Creator and Emancipator of the universe, through</xml>
<xml>His perfect Omnipresence, blesses us for the dissemination of true sublime</xml>
<xml>knowledge.</xml>
<xml>21. O men, just as I the Lord, propagate the knowledge of this</xml>
<xml>yajna in the world created by Me, and perform it through the bright sun,</xml>
<xml>stable Earth, vitalizing air and various kinds of breaths in the human</xml>
<xml>organism, so do ye. May you prepare, for your benefit, mixtures of</xml>
<xml>different medicines with water and with juices and dilute the same again</xml>
<xml>with distilled water. May you, thus, effect useful combinations of the</xml>
<xml>beneficial medicines, with refined tinctures.</xml>
<xml>22. I fully harness the yajna for the attainment of happiness and</xml>
<xml>material prosperity. This oblation is put into the fire, which expands,</xml>
<xml>reaches in the middle region of the sun and moon and produces food-stuff.</xml>
<xml>26 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>The yajna confers fuller life and happiness. May this yajna be pef fotmed</xml>
<xml>everywhere. May the performer of the yajna spread its knowledge. May</xml>
<xml>the sacrificial Agni keep us free from diseases. May the indwelling</xml>
<xml>Effulgent God, make our yajna perfect for the attainment of complete joys.</xml>
<xml>23. Be fearless and do not waver as to the performance of yajna.</xml>
<xml>Let the offspring of the performer of this yajna be excellent, faithful and</xml>
<xml>free from weakness. We whole heartedly take recourse to yajnas for the</xml>
<xml>realisation of the one Lord, for the purification of air and water and for</xml>
<xml>getting the blessings of mother, father and preceptor.</xml>
<xml>24. By the impulse of God the Giver of bliss, I perform the yajna</xml>
<xml>free from Hinsa (violence), for the attainment of noble qualities and</xml>
<xml>association of the learned, through the aid of life-giving-breath, vitalising</xml>
<xml>air, and through the rejuvenating rays of the sun and moon. A yajna is</xml>
<xml>the recipient of the rays of the sun that ripens a large variety of objects</xml>
<xml>and is full of immense lustre, and innumerable rays. A yajna is the</xml>
<xml>illuminating source of rain. With the aid of the yajna we should remove</xml>
<xml>our miseries.</xml>
<xml>25. O God, the Creator of the solar and bright regions we implore</xml>
<xml>Thee that through Thy grace, may we not destroy the medicinal herbs of</xml>
<xml>the earth, on which the learned perform the yajnas. May the yajna</xml>
<xml>reach the clouds. Let the sun pour rain on the earth through its rays.</xml>
<xml>O heroic persons bind by various fetters a wicked man in this world,</xml>
<xml>who is opposed to us and is opposed to by us, and release him not.</xml>
<xml>26. O' Omnipresent Lord, the Giver of happiness, may we subjugate</xml>
<xml>the wicked folk on this earth where the sages perform yajnas. May we</xml>
<xml>associate with the learned and, thus spread freely the system of education</xml>
<xml>as propounded in the Vedic hymns. Just as My light of knowledge is</xml>
<xml>valued by all, so should yours. The ignorant moving in the dark who are</xml>
<xml>opposed to the learned, and whom the learned disapprove for their</xml>
<xml>antagonism to knowledge, should be brought round to the path of virtue</xml>
<xml>by hundreds of means available and let the restriction on them be not</xml>
<xml>removed till their enlightenment. May the wicked, be not blessed with</xml>
<xml>prosperity, and the pleasure of knowledge. O Ye dutiful may ye</xml>
<xml>persistently follow the path of virtue.</xml>
<xml>Just as the light of the sun brightens up the mid-region so does God</xml>
<xml>23. Shri Jai Chand, Vidya Alankar, interprets the last portion of the Mantra as for the</xml>
<xml>mastery of the three Vedas, the two Vedas and One Veda. Recitation of Vedic hymns in the</xml>
<xml>performance of a yajna is essential, as by their constant repetitions, one masters them.</xml>
<xml>25. For the maintenance of peace and order in the society, it is essential to punish the</xml>
<xml>wicked. The Veda generally inculcates the spirit of non-hatred and mutual love, but where</xml>
<xml>this law is violated the violators have to be punished to bring them on the right path,</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER I 27</xml>
<xml>fulfil our desires. The sunjcontrols the earth by the force of</xml>
<xml>and ^ajjptftujfi ...... it ilLi</xml>
<xml>The cruel who are opposed to the just, and are opposed by the peace-</xml>
<xml>loving, be bound by all the means possible and be never let loose till they</xml>
<xml>have been brought to their senses.</xml>
<xml>27. I perform the yajna with the recitation of vedic verses in</xml>
<xml>Gayatri, Trishtup, and Jagati metres. O Earth, thou art beautiful, a</xml>
<xml>source of prosperity, and happiness, a fit place to dwell upon comfortably,</xml>
<xml>full of corn, milk, sweet juices and fruits.</xml>
<xml>28. O Almighty Lord Tbpu, hast suspended in space near Moon,</xml>
<xml>this Earth, full of foodstuffs, and producer of all the life-giving substances</xml>
<xml>for the living creatures. May the learned of refined intellect, full of</xml>
<xml>happiness, residing upon it, the well-wisher of all. abiding by Thy eternal</xml>
<xml>laws, conquer all foes waging severe fight with the aid of warriors and arms,</xml>
<xml>thus attain to power. O learned person, just as from times immemorial the</xml>
<xml>dutiful have been acquiring wealth, so do thou full of wealth worship God.</xml>
<xml>Let evil be eradicated.</xml>
<xml>29. The wicked should be removed, the enemies of truth should be</xml>
<xml>punished ; those fit to be shackled should be cast aside and those opposed</xml>
<xml>to knowledge should come to grief. Oh destroyer of foes, Thou art not</xml>
<xml>wrathful, I prepare thee full of virility for battle.</xml>
<xml>Those who can't tolerate the good of others must be chastised,</xml>
<xml>and openly condemned. Those who cause harm to others should be</xml>
<xml>humiliated. I duly instruct the army to be strong for weakening the foe,</xml>
<xml>and waging war.</xml>
<xml>30. O 1 Lord Thou art the Creator of juices in the soil. Thou art</xml>
<xml>the Omnipresent, the Pervader of all. Like the flame of fire Thou art in-</xml>
<xml>extinguishable. Thou art worthy of worship by the sages at all places,</xml>
<xml>meant for it, through the recitation of the vedic texts. May we realise</xml>
<xml>Thee through our peaceful spiritual vision, for our advancement.</xml>
<xml>31. I consecrate the yajna, which purifies all objects with the</xml>
<xml>27. According to some interpreters, Gayatri chhand is synonymous with a Brahman*</xml>
<xml>Trishtup with a Kshatriya, and Jagati with a Vaishya. Some interpret these verses as earth,</xml>
<xml>mid-region, and sun. Some interpret Gayatri as fire, Trishtup as air, and Jagati as sun. Some</xml>
<xml>interpret them as head, chest and loins, some as Vasu, Rudra and Aditya, and some as Pran,</xml>
<xml>Apan and Vyan. In prosody Gayatri metre consists of 24, Tnshtup of 44 & Jagati of 48</xml>
<xml>syllables just as a Vasu Brahmchari observes celibacy for 24 years, a Rudra for 44, and an</xml>
<xml>Aditya for 48 years.</xml>
<xml>31, I denotes the priest.</xml>
<xml>28 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>flawless, pure rays of the sun. In this world created by the Great Lord, I</xml>
<xml>sanctify the hearts and souls of the people by the pure and ever soul-</xml>
<xml>illuminating knowledge. O' Lord Thou art the source of all light, Pure,</xml>
<xml>Giver of the bliss of emancipation, the final resort of the universe ; fit to be</xml>
<xml>adored by the learned, loved by the sincere, fearless devotees, Invincible</xml>
<xml>and worshipped by the sages.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER II</xml>
<xml>1. Oh yajna, thou art being performed in a well dug place, them</xml>
<xml>art i?refied by fire and attracted by the air. For the sake of Havan I</xml>
<xml>consecrate the oblation agreeably rectified by thee. Thou art an alter</xml>
<xml>for taking the oblations high up into the space ; I erect thee and con-</xml>
<xml>secrate thee with ghee. Just jasjyater in the space contributes to the</xml>
<xml>purification of the material objects, so do I carefully cleanse the oblations</xml>
<xml>to be put into the fire ladles.</xml>
<xml>2. Yajna showers water on the Earth. Mortar is the chief receptacle</xml>
<xml>of the yajna. I prepare the altar for the learned to sit on. May those</xml>
<xml>scholars sing the praises of God, the Earth's Lord, the World's Lord,</xml>
<xml>the Lord of Kings.</xml>
<xml>3. The jsun^ sustainer of the world and the holder of the earth,</xml>
<xml>spreads the yajna far and wide for the happiness of the universe.</xml>
<xml>Adorable fire, being adored in the yajna, thou art the guardian of the</xml>
<xml>worshipper. O yajna thou art the induce r of rain through the power of</xml>
<xml>sun for the happiness of the universe. Adorable fire, being adored in</xml>
<xml>the yajna, thou art the guardian of the worshipper. Inhalation and</xml>
<xml>exhalation, for the happiness of the universe, protect thee (yajna) with</xml>
<xml>firm strength every now and then. Adorable fire, being adored in the</xml>
<xml>yajna, thou art the protector of the worshipper.</xml>
<xml>1. Adhvaryu. the priest speaks.</xml>
<xml>Thee refers to altar.</xml>
<xml>2. Mortar Vd<j<ri is the crown of yajna, for %fo for oblations is prepared through it.</xml>
<xml>By preparing the altar is meant spreading Asanas on it after washing and cleansing it, so</xml>
<xml>that the learned Pandits may sit on them, for participation in the performance of the yajna.</xml>
<xml>I refers to the worshipper the ZTOTH. Griffith following Mahidhar and Ubbat interprets</xml>
<xml>Bhuvpati, Bhuvanpati, and Bhutanampati, as three brothers of Agni ; which is manifestly</xml>
<xml>absurd. Kishi Dayananda interprets them as three manifestations of God.</xml>
<xml>3. Griffith in the Wake of Ubbat and Mahidhara considers Gandharva and Vishvavasu</xml>
<xml>as two Vedic deities. Rishi Dayananda interprets these words as meaning Sun, that holds</xml>
<xml>the Earth, and sustains the universe. (TRJ3 : ) 3t it tjfcrft ETTft TpEfg": <tytfo?l4>* I (ftara^O ffctf</xml>

<xml>4. May we, in a friendly spirit, manifest Thy glory Oh Omniscient,</xml>
<xml>All-illumining God, the Giver of great happiness to all, the Embodiment</xml>
<xml>of effulgence, and the Preacher of the yajnas.</xml>
<xml>5. Oh yajna, Thou art beautiful like the spring. The sun protects</xml>
<xml>thee from time immemorial, for unfolding all objects. Thou art diffused</xml>
<xml>through the power and potency (the two arms) of the sun. Just as</xml>
<xml>Vasus, Rudras, and Adityas promote the yajna, the giver of happiness,</xml>
<xml>pervaded in space, so do I for the acquisition of divine qualities, perform</xml>
<xml>the yajna.</xml>
<xml>6. Oh Yajna, thy name is sky, thou art full of butter, be confirmed</xml>
<xml>in this decorated place with thy lovely glory. Oh Yajna thy name is</xml>
<xml>space, thou art full of water, be confirmed in this decorated space with</xml>
<xml>thy lovely glory. Oh Yajna thy name is Earth, thou art the giver of</xml>
<xml>longevity, be confirmed in this decorated place with thy lovely glory.</xml>
<xml>May necessary articles be placed in the holy yajna. O God, may Thou</xml>
<xml>protect those articles, may Thou protect the Yajna, may Thou protect</xml>
<xml>the worshipper, may Thou protect me the conductor of the Yajna.</xml>
<xml>7. I kindle the fire, the giver of corn, full of intensity, the carrier of</xml>
<xml>all oblations to the sky, and the bringer of victory in war. The fire</xml>
<xml>properly used in the Yajna brings water through the forces of nature,</xml>
<xml>4. Swami Dayananda has put two interpretations upon this mantra. Agni has been</xml>
<xml>taken to mean God and physical fire. I have accepted the first interpretation, the second</xml>
<xml>one referring to fire also holds good.</xml>
<xml>5 . The power and potency ( 191 and $tf ) are spoken of as the two arms of the sun.</xml>
<xml>They help in the diffusion of the yajna. Vasus, Rudras and Adityas kave been translated by</xml>
<xml>some commentators as deities and by others as learned persons, who take part in the yajna.</xml>
<xml>Swami Dayananda translates Vasus as Agni, Prithvi, Vayu, Antriksha, Aditya, Dyau,</xml>
<xml>Chandrama and Nakshatra, as all living objects dwell and reside in these eight Vasus.</xml>
<xml>Rudras he translates as Pran, Apan, Vyan, Udan, Saman, Nag, Kurma, Krikal, Devadutta,</xml>
<xml>Dhananjay and Jeeva (Soul),</xml>
<xml>These eleven vital Breaths ^are called Rudras, as they make all relatives weep</xml>
<xml>when they leave the body at the time of death. The twelve months of the year are called</xml>
<xml>Adityas. The Vasus, Rudras and Adityas are helpful in the performance and promotion of</xml>
<xml>the Yajna. 'I* refers to the worshipper the performer of the Yajna.</xml>
<xml>6. In Yajna there are three ladies, named Juhu, Upabhrit and Dhruva. These three</xml>
<xml>are named in the universe as Dyau, Antriksha and Prithvi. In this mantra Juhu, means</xml>
<xml>sky, upabhrit means space, and Dhruva means Earth. All these three names are used for</xml>
<xml>the Yajna, with which they are connected cftsfg: Shatapatha 1. 3. 2.4.</xml>
<xml>SRTfaRjq^ Shatapatha 1. 3. 2. 4.</xml>
<xml>*ti ?e$ tyej H gj Shatapatha 1. 3. 2. 4.</xml>
<xml>Me refers to any of the Hota, Adhwaryu, Udgata or Brahma, the participating</xml>
<xml>priests of the Yajna.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER II 31</xml>
<xml>and food through the seasons that protect us. May these (water and food)</xml>
<xml>the givers of strength and power be for my use.</xml>
<xml>8. May I today for the acquisition of comforts collect through</xml>
<xml>Yajna butter and other articles which contribute to happiness.</xml>
<xml>O God may I never violate it (Yajna). O Lord may I obtain Thy</xml>
<xml>refuge, abounding in store of riches. This fire is the abode of yajna.</xml>
<xml>Through it (yajna) sun and air gain strength. This yajna resides in space</xml>
<xml>and fire.</xml>
<xml>9. Oh God protect the sun and earth, which protect the yajna.</xml>
<xml>Just as fire acquiring the yajna and acting as an envoy, protects the sun</xml>
<xml>and earth, so protect us, Oh Lord the doer of the noble deeds for</xml>
<xml>the learned. Just as the sun combining light with light through the</xml>
<xml>oblations put into fire, protects the heaven and earth so God guard us</xml>
<xml>with the light of spiritual knowledge. This is thus ordained in the</xml>
<xml>Veda.</xml>
<xml>10. May God bestow on me spiritual power. May we obtain</xml>
<xml>wealth full of various kinds of splendour, and earthly power. May our</xml>
<xml>desires be fulfilled, may they attain to fruition, Men use this Earth</xml>
<xml>and knowledge (whereby salvation is attained) for the pleasures of</xml>
<xml>kingship. May these Earth and knowledge advise me. May God, as</xml>
<xml>my last Refuge and resort instruct me. This is thus ordained in the</xml>
<xml>Veda.</xml>
<xml>11. I have prayed to the Effulgent, All sustaining God, May the</xml>
<xml>Lord Father accept my prayer. Our digestive faculty digests by means</xml>
<xml>of gastric juice the food put into the stomach. In this universe created</xml>
<xml>by the All-Blissful God, I take that food through the qualities of attraction</xml>
<xml>and retention, of inhalation and exhalation ; and the forces of purification</xml>
<xml>and permeation of the invigorating air, throughout the body. Cooking</xml>
<xml>my food in the burnt fire I eat it with my mouth.</xml>
<xml>8. Articles, necessary for the performance of yajna.</xml>
<xml>9. Agni is the messenger of the forces of nature, as it takes to sky, air, sun, etc. in a</xml>
<xml>rarefied form the oblations put into it.</xml>
<xml>10. HffiT and tfitft have not been translated by Swami Dayananda as mother and</xml>
<xml>Earth, but as knowledge whereby we attain to salvation, and earth that gives us various</xml>
<xml>sorts of pleasures.</xml>
<xml>11. ajfosft has been translated by some commentators as sun and moon, and by others</xml>
<xml>as vedic deities, but Swami Dayananda translates it as Pran and Apan. He considers Ashwin</xml>
<xml>to mean Pran and Apan, i.e., inhalation and exhalation the breaths we take in and out. Their</xml>
<xml>qualities of attraction and retention are their two arms. Pushan is not a god but invigorating</xml>
<xml>air, whose two hands are its forces of purification and permeation of the food taken.</xml>
<xml>32 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>12. Oh Lord the Creator of the universe, the Vedas and the</xml>
<xml>learned proclaim this fore-mentioned yajna of Thine for Brihaspati and</xml>
<xml>Brahma. Through that great sacrifice protect my yajna, protect the</xml>
<xml>performer of the yajna, protect Thou me.</xml>
<xml>13. May my active mind enjoy the yajna's provisions. May God</xml>
<xml>expand and preserve this unabandonable acquisition of knowledge, which</xml>
<xml>is a kind of yajna. May all the learned persons in the world rejoice. May</xml>
<xml>Om be seated in our hearts.</xml>
<xml>14. Oh God, may Thou be glorified by our praises sung through</xml>
<xml>Thy Vedas. May Thou promote our knowledge. Oh God, may we</xml>
<xml>advance our soul. O God Thou controllest the activities of all. Thou</xml>
<xml>art the embodiment of knowledge. Thou art Omniscient and the Bringer</xml>
<xml>of victory in battles. May we prosper and sing Thy praises. I become</xml>
<xml>pure and holy by following Thy commands.</xml>
<xml>15. May I achieve victory like the victory of Fire and Moon. May</xml>
<xml>I speed onward with the materials of war. May Fire and Moon, drive</xml>
<xml>off him who hates us, drive off the man whom we detest. May I remove</xml>
<xml>that sinful enemy by warlike, military skill and equipment. May I</xml>
<xml>achieve victory like the victory of Air and Lightning. May I achieve</xml>
<xml>happiness through the impulse of knowledge, used for the acquisition</xml>
<xml>of supremacy. May air and lightning properly employed, drive off</xml>
<xml>him who hates us, drive of the man whom we dislike. I purify this</xml>
<xml>ignorant person by the light of knowledge.</xml>
<xml>16. We perform the yajna for Vasus, Rudras and Adityas. The</xml>
<xml>light of the sun and earth bring thee (yajna) to light. The Pran (external</xml>
<xml>air) and Udan (internal air) protect thee through rain. Just as birds go</xml>
<xml>to their nests, so let us daily go to the yajna reciting Gayatri Mantras.</xml>
<xml>12. Brihaspati is ODC who protects and guards the vedic verses. Brahma is one who</xml>
<xml>has read and mastered all the four vedas. Yajnapati is the yajman, the worshipper.</xml>
<xml>13. Om is the most sacred name- of God.</xml>
<xml>15. Fire means a commander of the army and moon means a calm and considerate king.</xml>
<xml>5R may refer to the enemy or the disease which is the enemy of our body. The disease that</xml>
<xml>attacks us, and which we try to throw off, must be removed.</xml>
<xml>|-|J ft may mean 151 and cfa i.e., power and lustre vide TJto 30 1-22 or BUT and era vide qfto</xml>
<xml>12-8 or Pran and Udan vide Shatapatha 4-3-1-22. The victory of Agni and Som is the rightful</xml>
<xml>use in the universe, whereby victory is achieved in a battle. I may refer to the king or the</xml>
<xml>worshipper.</xml>
<xml>16. As for Vasus, Rudras and Adityas see footnote to 2.5. Prishni has been translated by</xml>
<xml>Ubbat and Mahidhar as cow that goes to heaven. The word means, oblation staying in the</xml>
<xml>space in its rarefied form.</xml>
<xml>The mantra merely explains the scientific process how rain is caused, but some commen-</xml>
<xml>tators have failed to grasp its real sense,</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER II 33</xml>
<xml>The desired oblation (Ahuti) reaches the space, comes in contact</xml>
<xml>with air and the light of tht sun. It thence brings down rain for us,</xml>
<xml>which fills streams and stalks of plants and flowers. Oh Fire thou pro-</xml>
<xml>tectest the eye from darkness, may thou protect my physical and spiritual</xml>
<xml>eye.</xml>
<xml>17. Oh Omnipresent God, extolled by the praises of the learned,</xml>
<xml>Thou attainest to greatness through those lovely panegyrics. I realise that</xml>
<xml>greatness of Thine in my heart. May I never disobey Thee. May I, Oh</xml>
<xml>God, never abuse the pleasant and invigorating food, I have secured in Thy</xml>
<xml>creation.</xml>
<xml>18. May ye thriving, justice loving, wise, learned persons, preachers</xml>
<xml>of the knowledge of the Vedas, become supreme through knowledge.</xml>
<xml>Let all seekers after truth, devotees of learning and action, attain to</xml>
<xml>happiness. Preach My noble word, that brings all kinds of joys.</xml>
<xml>19. Oh fire and air, ye are the bringers of rain. Ye protect the</xml>
<xml>yajna, and conduce to our comfort, bring comfort to me. God and humi-</xml>
<xml>lity are near me for my good, as they are for thine. Just as I derive</xml>
<xml>happiness by the performance of yajna, so should you.</xml>
<xml>20. Oh Immortal, Omnipresent God, protect me from intense pain,</xml>
<xml>protect me from the bondages of sin and ignorance, protect me from the</xml>
<xml>company of evil-minded persons, protect me from food injurious to health.</xml>
<xml>Make Thou our food free from poison. Let me live in a comfortable</xml>
<xml>house ; praying to Thee and doing noble needs. This is our prayer to the</xml>
<xml>Lord of the Universe, may we get pure knowledge through the vedas, the</xml>
<xml>givers of glory and prosperity.</xml>
<xml>21. Oh God, Thou knowest the animate and the inanimate creation.</xml>
<xml>Thou knowest everything in the universe. Just as Thou art the expo-</xml>
<xml>under of knowledge for the learned, so dost Thou expound knowledge</xml>
<xml>unto me. Ye learned people, who know how to sing praises unto God,</xml>
<xml>knowing the veda that shows the right path, should master knowledge.</xml>
<xml>Oh God, the Master of learning, rightfully fix this yajnalike world in</xml>
<xml>the air.</xml>
<xml>17. Griffith translates tffrft: as demons of darkness who steal the gods' cows, the rays of</xml>
<xml>light, and hide them in caverns. Swami Dayananda translate? the word as 'praises' sung by</xml>
<xml>the learned unto God. Paridhi has been translated by Griffith, Mahidhar and Ubbat as the</xml>
<xml>stick, which is put into the fire. Dayananda translates it as greatness,</xml>
<xml>19. Me : thesacrificer (Yajman)</xml>
<xml>20. fftST has been translated by Griffith as cohabitation by the husband and wife, sleep-</xml>
<xml>ing on the same couch. Rishi Dayananda translates it as Earth, and titaqfil as God who is the</xml>
<xml>lord of earth t sun and other worlds.</xml>
<xml>34 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>22. May the mighty space unite with oblation and butter. May it</xml>
<xml>unite with the twelve months of the year, and eight lifegiving age-</xml>
<xml>ncies and vital breaths, May the sun be harnessed with all its rays. May</xml>
<xml>pure water rain whenever duly consecrated oblations are offered.</xml>
<xml>23. Does anybody abandon the sacrifice ? He who abandons it, is</xml>
<xml>abandoned by God. For what purpose does the worshipper put the</xml>
<xml>oblations into the fire ? He does it for the happiness of all. He does it</xml>
<xml>for gaining strength, health and vigour. The inferior articles not used</xml>
<xml>in the sacrifice are the allotted portion of the fiends.</xml>
<xml>24. May we be endowed with the study of the Vedas, knowledge,</xml>
<xml>stout bodies, peaceful and devoted minds. May God, the Giver of happi-</xml>
<xml>ness grant us riches, and banish each blemish from our body.</xml>
<xml>25. The Yajna performed by us in Jagati metre goes up to the sky.</xml>
<xml>From there it is sent back and pleases the world. By means of this Yajna,</xml>
<xml>may we ward off the man who hates us, and him whom we detest.</xml>
<xml>The yajna performed by us in Trishtup metre goes up in the air.</xml>
<xml>From there it is released and affords happiness to the world by the</xml>
<xml>purification of air and water. By means of this yajna, we keep away the</xml>
<xml>man who hates us, and him whom we dislike. The yajna performed by us in</xml>
<xml>Gayatri metre spreads on the Earth, and being released from there goes</xml>
<xml>up to heaven, and purifies the objects of the Earth. By means of this</xml>
<xml>yajna we remove the man who hates us, and him whom we despise. By</xml>
<xml>the use of food purified through yajna, may we get happiness, for the</xml>
<xml>accomplishment of the yajna, and be combined with lustre.</xml>
<xml>22. iff s does not mean grass here as interpreted by Ubbat and Mahidhar. It means</xml>
<xml>Antriksha, the space, in which all things grow, increase and expand.</xml>
<xml>Swami Dayananda has translated the word as Antriksha. All the oblations mixed with</xml>
<xml>ghee, rise heavenwards in the space, when they are put into the fire. Adityas mean the twelve</xml>
<xml>months and Vasus, the eight lifegiving agencies explained in foot-note to 2.5. Space is intimate-</xml>
<xml>ly connected with these, faS^^T: means rays of the sun, and not certain gods as explained by</xml>
<xml>Griffith. *?*rot $F& ft$cl$9T : Shatapath 3-7-3-6 vishvedevas according to Shatapath Brahman</xml>
<xml>means rays. Swami Dayananda has translated the word as rays.</xml>
<xml>23. Rakhshasas means the evil minded persons, who do not perform yajna. They eat the</xml>
<xml>inferior articles rejected in the yajna.</xml>
<xml>25. The performance of the yajna by means of Gayatri, Trishtup and Jagati metres</xml>
<xml>means the recitation of the Veda Mantras in these metres throughout the yajna. We should</xml>
<xml>keep our enemies away from us through the strength and vigour we derive from the Yajnas.</xml>
<xml>Vishnu has been translated as God by Pt. Jai Chand Vidya Alankar. God pervades ths sky,</xml>
<xml>the air and earth nay throughout the universe, by means of hi<? Jagati Chhand, the power of</xml>
<xml>creating the world, His Trishtup Chhand, the operation of protecting the three worlds, and</xml>
<xml>His Gayatri chhand, the power of guarding the vital breaths.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER II 35</xml>
<xml>26. Oh God Thou art Self-Existent, Most Excellent, and Self</xml>
<xml>Effulgent, Giver art thou of knowledge. Give me knowledge. I follow the</xml>
<xml>command of God.</xml>
<xml>27. Oh Lord of the universe, Oh God, may I become a good</xml>
<xml>householder through Thee, the protector of the universe. Oh Lord may</xml>
<xml>Thou protect my house, being adored by me the guardian of my house.</xml>
<xml>May our domestic duties be performed free from idleness. May I live</xml>
<xml>for a hundred years day and night in the presence of God.</xml>
<xml>28. Oh God, the Lord of vows, pray grant me success in the</xml>
<xml>performance of the vows, which I have undertaken, and which I find</xml>
<xml>myself confident tc discharge. I reap as I sow.</xml>
<xml>29. Speak reverentially to the learned, the repository of know-</xml>
<xml>ledge. Speak sweetly and gently to your father, mother, teacher and the</xml>
<xml>Brahmchari. Exterminate all fiends and evil-minded persons in the</xml>
<xml>world.</xml>
<xml>30. Oh God remove from this world the demoniacal beings who</xml>
<xml>walk on the earth, dissembling their real intentions, who are immersed</xml>
<xml>in the attainment of their selfish aims, and are filled with evil ambitions.</xml>
<xml>31. In this world, let the wise and the learned enjoy, let them be</xml>
<xml>strong, healthy and pleased, according to their capacity. Let them be</xml>
<xml>happy, hale and hearty according to their resources.</xml>
<xml>32. Obeisance unto Yee, O Fathers, for the acquisition of happi-</xml>
<xml>ness and knowledge. Obeisance unto Yee, O Fathers for the removal of</xml>
<xml>misery and enemies. Obeisance unto Yee, O Fathers for longevity,</xml>
<xml>Obeisance unto Yee, O Fathers, for sovereignty, and display of justice.</xml>
<xml>Obeisance unto Yee, O Fathers, for the cessation of manifold calamities,</xml>
<xml>27. Our : Husband and wife. U^jfr means, according to Shri Jai Chand, Vidya</xml>
<xml>Alankar, not ^ift. A cart drawn by only one ox is called Scft. It can't work well. Just</xml>
<xml>as the cart drawn by two bullocks goes well without interruption, so should the household</xml>
<xml>affairs be performed through the joint deliberations of both the husband and wife, and not singly</xml>
<xml>and indtpendently. Swami Dayananda interprets the word as free from idleness.</xml>
<xml>28. God is the fulfiller of our vows. Whatever good or bad action a man performs,</xml>
<xml>he reaps accordingly the fruit thereof, and consequently becomes good or bad according to the</xml>
<xml>nature of his deeds. A man is the architect of his fate, as he sows so does he reap.</xml>
<xml>32. Fathers means the wise, the learned, the high souled, just, religious-minded,</xml>
<xml>philanthropic persons, who work for humanity, and are free from ignoble passions, selfish-</xml>
<xml>ness, and sordid motives.</xml>
<xml>The repetition of the words TO' is meant to indicate the different qualities of the</xml>
<xml>fathers. For fuller explanation see Swami Dayananda's Commentary , Ubbat, Mahidhar</xml>
<xml>and Griffith have interpreted ftcR"' as six seasons of the year.</xml>
<xml>36 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>obeisance unto yee, O Fathers, for righteous indignation. Fathers,</xml>
<xml>know our desire to acquire knowledge. Fathers, know our reverence</xml>
<xml>unto Ye is for your respect Fathers, come daily to our houses, and give</xml>
<xml>us instructions,</xml>
<xml>Fathers we always give unto yee, whatever we have.</xml>
<xml>We give yee these clothes, pray accept them.</xml>
<xml>33. Accept thou teacher, in the womb of thy discipleship, the</xml>
<xml>youth, with a garland of flowers in hand, eager for knowledge, so that he</xml>
<xml>may attain to full manhood.</xml>
<xml>34. Oh sons, please my parents and teachers by offering them</xml>
<xml>various juices, sweet waters, disease-dissipating articles, milk, clarified</xml>
<xml>butter, well-cooked food, and juicy fruits. Enjoy your own wealth, and</xml>
<xml>covet not the wealth of others.</xml>
<xml>33. Just as mother keeps the child in her womb, and slowly and gradually develops</xml>
<xml>its body by the use of proper diet and taking necessary precautions, so does a teacher, who</xml>
<xml>accepts a student in his discipleship, acting like a mother, develop the student physically,</xml>
<xml>intellectually, morally and spiritually by his teachings.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER III</xml>
<xml>1. Oh learned persons, kindle the fire with the wood sticks, with</xml>
<xml>butter, set ablaze the fire, which is worthy of respect like a Sanyasi. Put</xml>
<xml>oblations in this fire of the yajna.</xml>
<xml>2. Put the oblations of ghee that removes physical infirmities, into</xml>
<xml>this well ablaze, disease-killing fire present in all objects.</xml>
<xml>3. We fan with sticks of wood and ghee the fire, that is powerful</xml>
<xml>in splitting all things, and burns intensely.</xml>
<xml>4. O beautiful fire, wood sticks soaked with ghee go unto thee</xml>
<xml>along with oblations. May thou accept my fuel put into thee.</xml>
<xml>5. I lay upon the back of the Earth upon which the learned per-</xml>
<xml>form yajna, which is like Heaven in plenty, and like Earth in grandeur,</xml>
<xml>for gain of eatable food, this food-eating fire, that pervades the Earth,</xml>
<xml>Ether, and Sky.</xml>
<xml>6. This Earth revolves in the L. space, _jt revolves with its mother</xml>
<xml>water in its orbit. It inc^ej^oun^t^fatherTlEc^TiL</xml>
<xml>7. The lustre of this fire, goes up and comes down in the space</xml>
<xml>like exhalation and inhalation in the body. This great fire displays</xml>
<xml>the Sun.</xml>
<xml>2. Ghee is clarified butter. Agni is called \ifffift<^ as it is present in every object</xml>
<xml>created.</xml>
<xml>3. Agni may mean God as well- In that case the verse will be interpreted thus. O God,</xml>
<xml>we glorify Thee through yoga and spiritual force. O Omnipotent God, Thou art Great and</xml>
<xml>Resplendent. Here *Tfr?V:P is yoga, and ^ is the spiritual force; flfo%*l means the powerful</xml>
<xml>God, Who unites and disunites all things in the world.</xml>
<xml>4. In this verse also 3ffR may mean God. The verse would then be interpreted thus.</xml>
<xml>O God, may my austerity, knowledge, worship and yoga, which contribute to my learning,</xml>
<xml>splendour and beauty, be accepted by Thee.</xml>
<xml>5. jjjj'tp ?*n mean (1) Earth, Ether, Sky or (2) Brahman, Kshatriya, Vaish or</xml>
<xml>(3) Subjects, offspring, cattle, or (4) Rig, Yaju, Sama. Mahidhara and Ubbat have ascribed</xml>
<xml>these meanings to these vayahritis. May I become plentiful like Heaven. As heaven is full of</xml>
<xml>stars, so I may he endowed with progeny and cattle. May I spread like the earth. As earth</xml>
<xml>gives shelter to many, so I may afford shelter to the distressed.</xml>
<xml>6. Water is the mother of Earth, as Earth is produced by the mixture of the particles</xml>
<xml>of water with its own particles, and remains pregnant with water. Sun is the father of the</xml>
<xml>Earth, as from the Sun, it derives all light and sustenance.</xml>
<xml>7. Lightning is the lustre of fire. Just as Praa and Apan go up and down in the body*</xml>
<xml>so does fire rise in the sky and then it comes down.</xml>
<xml>38 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>8. God's word rules supreme throughout the world. The Vedas</xml>
<xml>arc recited for acquiring the knowledge of God. We should resolutely</xml>
<xml>recite and understand the Vedas everyday with their illuminating</xml>
<xml>sayings.</xml>
<xml>9. Just as God gives the light of truthful speech to all human</xml>
<xml>beings, so does physical fire give light that illumines all substances.</xml>
<xml>Just as God inculcates knowledge in the souls of all, that man should</xml>
<xml>speak, as he feels in his heart, so does the Sun bring to light all physical</xml>
<xml>objects. Just as God reveals for humanity all the four Vedas, the store-</xml>
<xml>house of knowledge, so doesJSreJn_thc_shape_ ofjlightning^^exist in the</xml>
<xml>space, and become the source of rain and knowledge.</xml>
<xml>Just as God, through the Vedas displays all sciences, fire, and</xml>
<xml>lightning, so does the Sun develop our physical and spiritual forces.</xml>
<xml>Sun illumines all objects. God is self-Resplendent. This is the</xml>
<xml>manifestation of His Glory.</xml>
<xml>10. This enjoyable fire, in accompaniment with the recital of</xml>
<xml>Vcdic texts, mixed with God's creation and dark night, with flashes of</xml>
<xml>lightning pervades all objects.</xml>
<xml>This sun, mixed with God's creation and brilliant dawn, receives</xml>
<xml>the oblations put into the fire, and carries them to places far and wide.</xml>
<xml>11. Performing sacrifice, may we pronounce vedic texts, in praise</xml>
<xml>of God, who hears us from far and near.</xml>
<xml>12. Men should worship God alone, who is the Great and Supreme</xml>
<xml>Lord, who sustains the luminous Sun, and the non-luminous Earth, who</xml>
<xml>knows the formation of the vitality of waters.</xml>
<xml>13. Oh Electricity and Fire, I invoke Ye both for knowing your</xml>
<xml>attributes, for enjoying the pleasures of riches. Ye both are the givers</xml>
<xml>of desired sovereignty. Ye twain I invoke for consuming excellent food.</xml>
<xml>8. BttTgtiW according to Ubbat means the thirty parts gtftf of the day. According to</xml>
<xml>Mahidhar, it means the thirty days of the month. According to Swami Dayananda it means the</xml>
<xml>thirty three devatas, excluding the space (Antriksha), Sun, and Fire. The word 'thirty* realms'</xml>
<xml>means all the parts of the world. The number thirty is used indefinitely.</xml>
<xml>He!* means physical fire and God. TfltPmay mean speech and the word of God.</xml>
<xml>9. These are Agni Hotra Mantras for morning and evening.</xml>
<xml>12. *tlR means physical fire as well. Rishi Dayananda has given both the spiritual</xml>
<xml>and physical interpretations of this mantra. I have chosen the former where Agni means</xml>
<xml>God.</xml>
<xml>13. The proper application of fire and electricity in industries and machines, and full</xml>
<xml>knowledge of their attributes lead to the acquisition of wealth, enjoyment, worldly happiness</xml>
<xml>and greatness.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER III 39</xml>
<xml>14. Ob God, in Thy creation, sacrificial fire, whose cause of birth</xml>
<xml>is air, burns in different seasons, and develops in all directions. Knowing</xml>
<xml>this, cause our riches increase.</xml>
<xml>15. In this world the instructors and the learned kindle in</xml>
<xml>serviceable yajnas, for mankind, the ubiquitous fire of extra-ordinary</xml>
<xml>qualities.</xml>
<xml>That fire is recognised by the regulators of sacrifice as worthy of</xml>
<xml>adoration, as the first means of the performance of a yajna, as the</xml>
<xml>receiver of sacrifice aad giver of happiness and scientific knowledge.</xml>
<xml>16. The learned, knowing the eternity, lustre, thousandfold service,</xml>
<xml>and usefulness of fire, get pure water from it.</xml>
<xml>17. Thou. God, art our bodies 1 protector. Protect Thou my body.</xml>
<xml>Giver of longevity art Thou, O God, Give me longevity.</xml>
<xml>Giver of splendour art Thou, O God, Give me splendour.</xml>
<xml>Remove, O God, all the defects of my body and soul.</xml>
<xml>18. Oh God, the Lord of manifold riches, may we, being free from</xml>
<xml>pride, enjoying long life, and practising forbearance, live for a hundred</xml>
<xml>years, praising Thee the Effulgent, the Eternal, the Forbearing, the Un-</xml>
<xml>conquerable, and the Killer of foes.</xml>
<xml>Through Thy kindness, being free from woes, may we attain to</xml>
<xml>happiness.</xml>
<xml>19. Oh God, Thou art full of splendour like the Sun, sung by the</xml>
<xml>sages with vedic verses, and O Thou full of power for protection May I</xml>
<xml>attain to long life, to splendour, to offspring, and abundant riches.</xml>
<xml>20. May I enjoy the life-bestowing food through the plants</xml>
<xml>and medicines that contribute to health and vigour. May I utilise the</xml>
<xml>science of air and water for the accomplishment of my deeds. May I</xml>
<xml>get the essence of food from milk, honey and fruits. May I enjoy the</xml>
<xml>abundance of good articles through objects full of manifold qualities.</xml>
<xml>15. Apnawana (TOSH) has been translated by Mahidhar, as a Rishi, belonging to the</xml>
<xml>Bhrigu family. There is no history in the Veda ; hence his interpretation is inadmissible.</xml>
<xml>Swami Dayananda translates Apnavana as a learned instructor who teaches his sons, and</xml>
<xml>Bhrigu as a wise person who knows how to perform a yajna.</xml>
<xml>16. When Havan is performed in the fire, the result is the raining of pure water on</xml>
<xml>the Earth.</xml>
<xml>18. Ubbat and Mahidhar translate firaratft as night, in which shine different stars and</xml>
<xml>darkness resides. Maharshi Dayananda translates it as God, in whom reside the manifold</xml>
<xml>riches of the world, and who is the source of all wealth.</xml>
<xml>40 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>21. Oh Vcdic speech, may thou remain in this altar in this yajnd,</xml>
<xml>in this spot and in this house. Remain here, and go not far from hence.</xml>
<xml>22. Oh universal vedic text, thou art full of vigour and valour,</xml>
<xml>may we attain unto thee, the master of the yajna. O God, may we</xml>
<xml>be in communion with Thee, everyday, morning and evening, bowing</xml>
<xml>unto Thee through our intellect.</xml>
<xml>23. May we worship God, Who is the Guardian of sacrifices,</xml>
<xml>Radiant, the Revealer of the vedas, and attained to complete redemption.</xml>
<xml>24. Oh God, Thou givest unto us knowledge, as a father to his son.</xml>
<xml>Unite us perpetually with pleasure.</xml>
<xml>25. Oh God, Thou art the Bestower on us of ears to hear goodness,</xml>
<xml>the Shelter of mankind, the Embodiment of the lustre of knowledge, and</xml>
<xml>real Omnipresence. Thou pervadest our soul. Thou art our Protector,</xml>
<xml>Our Benefactor, and possessest excellent nature, attributes and deeds.</xml>
<xml>Give us wealth most splendidly renowned.</xml>
<xml>26. O most pure, O radiant God, verily do we pray to Thee for the</xml>
<xml>happiness of our friends. Give us knowledge, listen to our praises and</xml>
<xml>prayers, and keep us far from every evil.</xml>
<xml>27. O God, may I get land for ruling over it, may I be endowed</xml>
<xml>with statesmanship. May noble desires reside in me. May I be the</xml>
<xml>centre of the fulfilment of all ambitions.</xml>
<xml>28. O God, the Guardian of the primordial vedas, make me, like the</xml>
<xml>son of a learned person, endowed with different capacities for the acquisi-</xml>
<xml>tion of knowledge, an imparter of instruction, and a fulfiller of the aim of</xml>
<xml>education.</xml>
<xml>29. God is rich and the dispeller of ignorance. He knows the true</xml>
<xml>nature of all things, and grants us physical and spiritual strength. He</xml>
<xml>is prompt. May he goad us to noble deeds.</xml>
<xml>30. O God, may not our knowledge of the Vedas ever perish. May</xml>
<xml>Thou preserve us from the violence of the uncharitable person.</xml>
<xml>21. Revati has been translated as wise policy by Swami Dayanandji. According to this</xml>
<xml>interpretation the Mantra may mean 'Oh -wise policy, 'Oh Statesmanship, may thou remain in</xml>
<xml>this abode, this fold, this spot and this dwelling. 'Remain just here and go not thence.'</xml>
<xml>Wi tq* I Shatapath 3-8-1421.</xml>
<xml>28. Ubbat and Mahidhar translate Kakshivant as a Rishi, whose mother was Ushik, and</xml>
<xml>father Dirghatama. This interpretation involving history is not apt, as the vedas are free</xml>
<xml>from historical references, due to their primordiality and eternity. Swami Dayananda translates</xml>
<xml>Ushik as the son of a learned person and Kakshivant as full of different capabilities! modes</xml>
<xml>and methods for the acquisition of knowledge.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER III 41</xml>
<xml>31. God, may we get the great, wise and unassailable protection</xml>
<xml>of the three forces of nature, the water, the sun and the air.</xml>
<xml>32. Those who worship God are not molested by evil-minded foes</xml>
<xml>neither at home, nor upon pathways and battlefields. I become capable</xml>
<xml>of acquiring God and the sages.</xml>
<xml>33. They, the sons of indestructible matter, bestow eternal light</xml>
<xml>upon man for his life and death.</xml>
<xml>34. O God, Thou art the giver of happiness. If Thou dost not</xml>
<xml>bestow knowledge promptly on a charitable person, he again, O</xml>
<xml>Liberal Lord, does not attain to Thy bounty.</xml>
<xml>35. O Creator of the Universe I O All holy and worthy of</xml>
<xml>adoration ! May we meditate on Thy adorable self. May Thou guide our</xml>
<xml>understanding.</xml>
<xml>36. Oh God, may Thine immortal knowledge, wherewith Thou</xml>
<xml>guardest the learned in all directions, come close from all sides.</xml>
<xml>37. O God, friendly to the wise, do Thou protect my offspring. O</xml>
<xml>worthy of praise do Thou protect my cattle. O God, above all suspicion,</xml>
<xml>protect my food. O God, through Thy grace, in unison with the three</xml>
<xml>life-winds, Pran, Apan and Vyan, may I be rich in offspring, well-manned</xml>
<xml>with men, a hero with the heroes, and strong with wise and invigorating</xml>
<xml>deeds.</xml>
<xml>33. Aditi has been interpreted differently. It means (1) Earth (2) Matter (3) Veda</xml>
<xml>(4) Forces of Nature.</xml>
<xml>i frtfo i n</xml>
<xml>I 3To 6-5-2-5.</xml>
<xml>Ed according to Nighantu and Shatapath Aditi mean*</xml>
<xml>'They' refers to Mitra, Aryama and Varuna, i.e., the air, the sun and the water. They</xml>
<xml>are the sons of Matter, as they protect mankind from misery. 33 is one who helps his parents</xml>
<xml>in crossing the ocean of worldly miseries. As air, sun, and water help mankind to overcome</xml>
<xml>difficulties and physical infirmities, they are hence named as sons of Nature.</xml>
<xml>34. God is the giver of the fruits of our actions. If this be not so, man will never</xml>
<xml>systematically and according to Law, reap the fruits of his actions.</xml>
<xml>35. This is the Gayatri Mantra, the Lord's Prayer of the Aryans. This is considered</xml>
<xml>to be the best and most perfect form of prayer, as in it we pray not for one's selfish advance-</xml>
<xml>ment, but for the betterment of humanity. We pray not for things mundane, which we can</xml>
<xml>acquire through our intellect and understanding, but for the purification of our loftiest and</xml>
<xml>noblest gift, the wise understanding. We don't pray for bread, and physical objects and</xml>
<xml>comforts. Highest form of prayer is offered to God, the Highest Authority. This prayer is</xml>
<xml>perfect as it contains all the three elements of prayer, i.e., laudation, 'Fg^T supplication</xml>
<xml>and meditation</xml>
<xml>42 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>38. O, Ocean of Light, the Omniscient, the best knower of all the</xml>
<xml>worlds, and enjoyments may we well approach Thee. May Thou spread</xml>
<xml>for us splendour and strength in all directions.</xml>
<xml>39. Lord of our houses, O God, Thou art the best finder of riches</xml>
<xml>for our children, Thou art the protector of our hearths, and the com-</xml>
<xml>panion of the householders. Bestow splendour and strength on us.</xml>
<xml>40. This fire assists us in the accomplishment of our deeds. It is</xml>
<xml>rich, and furtherer of plenty. O God, the Giver of our comforts, bestow</xml>
<xml>splendour and strength upon us.</xml>
<xml>41. Fear not, nor tremble Ye, O householders. We, bearing strength,</xml>
<xml>come to Ye. May I bearing strength, intelligent and happy, rejoicing in</xml>
<xml>my mind, enjoy all pleasures and approach the householders.</xml>
<xml>42. We praise the householders, whom the guest staying far from</xml>
<xml>home remembers and whom he loves much. The loving householders</xml>
<xml>welcome us, the religious guests.</xml>
<xml>43. May we in this world get cows, goats, sheep and abundant</xml>
<xml>food in our houses. I come to you for safety and quietude, May I acquire</xml>
<xml>mundane and celestial joy and felicity.</xml>
<xml>44. We invocate the guests, who are delightful, free from ignorance,</xml>
<xml>removers of sins, eaters of the food well cooked, and full of knowledge.</xml>
<xml>45. May we forsake each sinful act that we have committed in</xml>
<xml>village or solitude, in an assembly or corporeal sense. Let every man so</xml>
<xml>resolve.</xml>
<xml>46. O God, protect us in battles, in this world, with the help of</xml>
<xml>heroes and destroy us not. O mighty hero, verily, as the vedic voice, re-</xml>
<xml>40. (Pareeshya) yffiQ has been translated by Ubbat and Mahidhar, as Master of the</xml>
<xml>cattle. Swami Dayananda translates it as helper in the doing of deeds, and giver of comforts.</xml>
<xml>It means water as well.</xml>
<xml>Vide Nighantu 1-12.</xml>
<xml>It also means earth, vide Shatapath 12-5-2-5.</xml>
<xml>41. We and I refer to the learned persons.</xml>
<xml>43 We and you refer to householders, and I to a learned person. SftfM used twice refers to</xml>
<xml>earthly happiness, and happiness after death.</xml>
<xml>44. The householders should always serve the learned, delightful, and pious guests who</xml>
<xml>are Atithis, i.e., whose date of coming is not fixed. Griffith following Mahidhar puts this</xml>
<xml>mantra in the mouth of the sacrificer's wife, who is first called upon to confess her infidelities,</xml>
<xml>if she has been guilty of any and to declare the name or names of her lover or lovers. After</xml>
<xml>confession or declaration of innocence, she is made to recite the text." This is humbug and</xml>
<xml>sheer nonsense.</xml>
<xml>45. Corporeal sense means by abuse of the mind, tongue, eye, ear or any other sensual</xml>
<xml>organ.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER III 43</xml>
<xml>plete with noble virtues, offering oblations, displays the qualities of the</xml>
<xml>learned worshippers, so does the worshipper, put oblations into the fire,</xml>
<xml>which contribute to the happiness of mankind.</xml>
<xml>47. They, who with delightful vedic voice, working in cooperation,</xml>
<xml>perform their desired deeds, go to their comfortable house, after the com-</xml>
<xml>pletion of their task for the acquisition of noble virtues.</xml>
<xml>48. O purified through knowledge and righteousness, O patient</xml>
<xml>teacher of grammar, just as I a seeker after knowledge, and a firm gleaner</xml>
<xml>of wisdom, wash out the sin that I have committed through my senses</xml>
<xml>and the mortal body, so do thou O God, preserve me from tortuous sin.</xml>
<xml>49. The oblation full of cooked articles put into the fire, goes up to</xml>
<xml>the sky. and returns therefrom full of rain.</xml>
<xml>O God, Let us twain, like traders, barter our food and strength.</xml>
<xml>50. Give me this article and I will give you that in return. Keep</xml>
<xml>this as my deposit, I keep this as your deposit. Give me the cash price</xml>
<xml>for it. I give you the price demanded. Let people thus transact business</xml>
<xml>truthfully.</xml>
<xml>51. Thou chairman, just as comrades, luminous in themselves,</xml>
<xml>pleasing others, advanced in knowledge, with their sharpest intellect, do</xml>
<xml>verily praise God, and being regaled with nutritious diet, overcome</xml>
<xml>miseries, so do thou yoke thy vigour and prowess with them.</xml>
<xml>52. We revere Thee, O God of Bounty, Who art fair to see. Being</xml>
<xml>praised by us, O best companion, Thou fulfillest all our desires. O Lord,</xml>
<xml>yoke Thy vigour and prowess for us.</xml>
<xml>53. By reflecting on the merits of the learned, and following the</xml>
<xml>49. When we perform Homa, the oblation put into the fire, being rarefied goes up to th</xml>
<xml>sky, wherefrom, it comes back in the shape of rain. We two, the worshipper who performs the</xml>
<xml>Yajna, and the priest who officiates, barter our food and strength-giving articles, i.e , we put</xml>
<xml>these into the fire, and get. in return, rain, which gives us happiness, ripens our harvest of</xml>
<xml>grain and helps the growth of medicinal herbs. This process of giving and taking has been</xml>
<xml>described as a kind of bartering, as does a trader who gives articles, and takes cash in return.</xml>
<xml>50. In this verse, it is stated that all borrowing and lending, all sales and purchases, all</xml>
<xml>mortgages and deposits should be carried on in strict compliance with the principle of truth*</xml>
<xml>There should be no fraud and falsehood exercised in business. All dealings should be plain,</xml>
<xml>straightforward and true.</xml>
<xml>51. There ought to be full cooperation between the president of a society and its</xml>
<xml>members.</xml>
<xml>53. Lives of great-men teach us many lessons. We should learn from and profit by the,</xml>
<xml>experiences of great souls, and try to emulate them*</xml>
<xml>44 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>high principles of the elders, we strengthen our mind through non-</xml>
<xml>attachment.</xml>
<xml>54. May we get in future births again and again the mind, for</xml>
<xml>doing virtuous deeds, for acquiring strength, for longevity, and contem-</xml>
<xml>plation of God'for long.</xml>
<xml>55. O venerable elders, may this man endowed with godly qualities,</xml>
<xml>give us in this and the next life, intellect whereby we may enjoy a long</xml>
<xml>life and perform noble deeds.</xml>
<xml>56. O God, acting upon Thy Law, possessing mental self-conscious-</xml>
<xml>ness in healthy bodies, blest with progeny, let us enjoy happiness.</xml>
<xml>57. O learned person, the chastiser of the sinful and the unright-</xml>
<xml>eous, all these eatable things are for thee. Accept them with thy know-</xml>
<xml>ledge and vedic lore. O learned man, follow the Veda and the law of</xml>
<xml>Dharma. O learned person, accept the food worth eating which uproots</xml>
<xml>all diseases.</xml>
<xml>58. May we ward off all calamities by worshipping God, Who is</xml>
<xml>unchangeable in the past, presenr and future, chastises the sinners, and is</xml>
<xml>highly benevolent. Just as God makes us better housed, more prosperous,</xml>
<xml>and determined so may we adore Him.</xml>
<xml>59. O God, Thou art the healer of the physical, mental and spiri-</xml>
<xml>tual maladies. Heal, Thou the sufferings of cow, horse and all mankind.</xml>
<xml>Grant happiness to ram and ewe.</xml>
<xml>60. We worship the Omnipresent, Pure God, Who augments our</xml>
<xml>54, 55. Both the verses preach the transmigration of soul.</xml>
<xml>57. Ambika has been translated by Ubbat and Mahidhar as the sister of god Rudra.</xml>
<xml>Swami Dayananda translates it as vedic text, UTCJ has been interpreted by Ubbat and Mahi-</xml>
<xml>dhar as a mouse, on whose hole, a pudding is to be put. Maharshi Dayananda translates it as</xml>
<xml>a remover of diseases.</xml>
<xml>58. Triyambaka has been translated differently by various commentators, e.g., free</xml>
<xml>from the threefold sufferings, i e. physical^elemental and spiritual, and beyond the reach of</xml>
<xml>time, i.e., Past, Present and Future, or ruling over the three worlds.</xml>
<xml>Triyambaka is interpreted by Griffith as a name of Rudra as having three wives, sisters</xml>
<xml>or mothers, or Triocular, the Three Eyed God. Rishi Dayananda's interpretation is more</xml>
<xml>rational and significant. He interprets the word as God Who remains unchanged in the Past,</xml>
<xml>Present and Future.</xml>
<xml>39. The enumeration of a few animals like cow, horse, ram and ewe, is symbolic of the</xml>
<xml>animal kingdom. Praytr is offered for the happiness of mankind and animal world.</xml>
<xml>60. Just as a cucumber, when ripe, falls, full of sweetness, of its own accord, to the</xml>
<xml>ground, so should we die when we have spent our full age of at least one hundred years. Our</xml>
<xml>death should be easy, and natural, free from the protracted, and excruciating agonies of</xml>
<xml>death, to which several persons are subjected. We should in no case be deprived of our</xml>
<xml>immortal life through salvation, which is the aim of this worldly life.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER III</xml>
<xml>45</xml>
<xml>physical, spiritual and social forces. Through His Grace may we be re-</xml>
<xml>leased from this mortal coil without the agony of death, as naturally as a</xml>
<xml>ripe cucumber is from its stem. Let us not be bereft of immortality. We</xml>
<xml>worship the Omnipresent, Pure God, Who grants us wisdom. Through</xml>
<xml>His Grace, may we be released easily from this world, as a ripe cucumber</xml>
<xml>is from its stem, but not from immortality.</xml>
<xml>61. O hero, the chastiser of enemies, and expert in the art of war,</xml>
<xml>with bow extended, with self-protecting trident, with full armour, with</xml>
<xml>grace and power, meet thy foes on the other side of the mountain. With</xml>
<xml>thy this power of protection, come to us, without causing us any harm.</xml>
<xml>62. May we be endowed with triple life, as a truth-seer sage, or the</xml>
<xml>custodian of knowledge through the grace of God, is endowed with, or as</xml>
<xml>the learned persons enjoy triple life.</xml>
<xml>63. O God, Thou art certainly the Embodiment* of grace, self-</xml>
<xml>Existent, our Father, obeisance be to Thee. Harm me not. I approach</xml>
<xml>Thee for long life, for nice food, for progeny, for riches in abundance, for</xml>
<xml>noble children, and for heroic vigour.</xml>
<xml>62. 5Zn*pn3[ means three times the ordinary span of life, i.e., three times a hundred years.</xml>
<xml>May we live for 300 years or more, like the sages of yore. ^ll^VH may al^o mean the three</xml>
<xml>stages of life, boyhood, youth and old age, or Brahmacharya, Griha^tha and Vanaprastha</xml>
<xml>Ashramas.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER IV</xml>
<xml>1. May we, on this earth, where reside happily all the learned</xml>
<xml>persons, be able to revere the sages</xml>
<xml>May we acting on the teachings of the Rig, Sam and Yajur Vedas, end</xml>
<xml>all our miseries. May we rejoice in food and growth of riches. These</xml>
<xml>pure, disease-killing waters be gracious to me. May the herbs protect me</xml>
<xml>Thou armed king, harm not the worshipper.</xml>
<xml>2. May waters, like mother, purify our bodies. May the waters</xml>
<xml>purified by clarified butter, purify us through rain. Pure waters remove</xml>
<xml>all our physical imperfections.</xml>
<xml>May I advance in life, being bright and pure through waters. Through</xml>
<xml>celibacy and absteniousness may I possess a body, healthy, comfortable,</xml>
<xml>excellent, beautiful and strong.</xml>
<xml>3. O Sun, thou bringest rain on different parts of the earth. Giver</xml>
<xml>of splendour art thou } bestow on me the gift of splendour. The disperser</xml>
<xml>of cloud art thou with thy brilliance. The giver of eye art thou. Give</xml>
<xml>we the gift of vision.</xml>
<xml>4. Purify me, the Lord of Purity. Purify me, the Lord of knowledge,</xml>
<xml>Purify me, the Lord of the Vedas.</xml>
<xml>O Lord, Creator of the universe, purify me, through sun-beams and</xml>
<xml>thy immortal purifying knowledge.</xml>
<xml>O Master of the purified souls, may I full of lofty sentiments accom-</xml>
<xml>plish the desire actuated by which, through your grace, I purify myself.</xml>
<xml>5. O sages, we admire your praiseworthy qualities, during the</xml>
<xml>performance of this happy sacrifice. O sages, we beg of you the fulfilment</xml>
<xml>of our desires pertaining to the sacrifice.</xml>
<xml>6. O men, just as I actively and wisely commence performing</xml>
<xml>the sacrifice, with vedic texts, with cultured tongue, with wisdom-</xml>
<xml>teaching voice, with a tongue full of sweetness and truth, in an orderly</xml>
<xml>and well-directed way, with the help of the extended firmament, Earth,</xml>
<xml>sky and air, so do Ye.</xml>
<xml>2. Ghee when used in Havan, purifies the rain, and water, which in turn purifies our</xml>
<xml>bodies, and removes our physical infirmities and defects.</xml>
<xml>3. Sun gives light to the eyes, so he is addressed as giver of eyes.</xml>
<xml>6. A sage or a learned person says this to ordinary householders and men of the world.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER iV &</xml>
<xml>^. We perform the yajna for resolution for good religious acts,</xml>
<xml>for kindling fire, for the propagation of the Vedas, for the development</xml>
<xml>of wisdom, for the enhancement of knowledge, for utilizing lightning,</xml>
<xml>for philanthropy, for following the laws of Dharma, for austerity, for</xml>
<xml>digestive faculty, for learning and teaching, for eloquent and weighty</xml>
<xml>speech, for worshipping rightly God, for purifying gastric juice, and for</xml>
<xml>practising Truth.</xml>
<xml>Ye, meritorious, all-beneficial divine waters, Ye Heaven and Earth</xml>
<xml>and spacious air between them, we serve with Oblation.</xml>
<xml>8. May every mortal man seek the friendship of the Guiding God.</xml>
<xml>May we all have recourse to the use of arms for the acquisition of due</xml>
<xml>wealth. May every man acquire riches and become strong through wise</xml>
<xml>deeds.</xml>
<xml>9. After the study of the Rig and Yajur Vedas, I commence using</xml>
<xml>their scientific aspLCts, i.e., theoretical and practical. They protect m?</xml>
<xml>in this yajna, in which vedic texts are recited. O yajna, thou art</xml>
<xml>happiness, give me happiness ; here are these oblations of corn for thee ;</xml>
<xml>forbear to harm me.</xml>
<xml>10. O learned person, may mechanical science, perfected by the</xml>
<xml>application of fire, the giver of light, bestow strength on me. It is the</xml>
<xml>guardian of manifold objects, giver of happiness to the learned, the</xml>
<xml>mechanic, and the source of prosperity, make the crops produce abundant</xml>
<xml>grain through its aid. O learned person, depend on thyself for</xml>
<xml>advancement. Protect me from the misery of sin. Accomplish this</xml>
<xml>yajna with the recitation of vedic texts.</xml>
<xml>11. Take a vow. God is Agni. Yajna is Agni. God, the Guardian</xml>
<xml>of our soul, is fit for worship. For the attainment of an ideal, I long</xml>
<xml>for divine, pleasant, radiant intelligence that unites me with God. May</xml>
<xml>that intelligence, that makes me happily cross the ocean of this mundane</xml>
<xml>existence, be within my control.</xml>
<xml>May the philosophic, meditative and energetic sages urge us on to</xml>
<xml>noble deeds, may they be our protectors. We invoke them from the</xml>
<xml>inmost recesses of our heart.</xml>
<xml>9. The two aspects of the vedas may be Karma and Jnan Kand, the practical and</xml>
<xml>theoretical sides.</xml>
<xml>God may also be addressed as yajna, then TO will mean obeisance ; and 3rf will mean</xml>
<xml>shelter. God affords shelter to all.</xml>
<xml>48 VAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>12. O men, the waters that we have ,lrunk, staying within our</xml>
<xml>belly, give us peace, riches, freedom from consumption, disease, and pangs</xml>
<xml>of hunger and thirst. They are the strengthened of our true knowledge,</xml>
<xml>full of divine qualities, and undying flavours. May they be pleasant to</xml>
<xml>your taste.</xml>
<xml>13. O learned man, just as this sacrificial body of thine, protects</xml>
<xml>the vital breaths and the people, and thou forsakest it not, so do I not</xml>
<xml>forsake it without enjoying the full span of life. Just as disease curing</xml>
<xml>and pure waters flow on the earth, so shouldst thou live in the world</xml>
<xml>wisely ; and so do I.</xml>
<xml>14. The fire, which keeps us active in our wakeful state, makes us</xml>
<xml>take joy in most refreshing sleep. It protects us free from idleness and</xml>
<xml>casts away the idlers. We should use this fire properly which deals with</xml>
<xml>us again and again.</xml>
<xml>15. I get back after rebirth mind, life, bre.ith, soul, eyes and ears.</xml>
<xml>May God the Leader of all, Non-violent, Omniscient, Guardian</xml>
<xml>of our souls, save us from misfortune and sin.</xml>
<xml>16. O God, Thou art the Guardian of sacred vows among mankind.</xml>
<xml>Thou art meet for praise at holy rites. O Giver of Splendour, Come</xml>
<xml>unto us, grant us wealth, give us more. God, the Creator, the Giver of</xml>
<xml>wealth, gives us riches.</xml>
<xml>17. O learned person, this body thou hast got and reared is for</xml>
<xml>the meditation of God and sacrifice. Through this body, being vigorous,</xml>
<xml>gain splendour and lustre. Be active through knowledge.</xml>
<xml>18. O resplendent God, in this world created by Thee, may I obtain</xml>
<xml>mastery over the vast power of speech. O Speech, thou art pure, pleasant</xml>
<xml>and dear to the sages.</xml>
<xml>12. ^T31: may be translated as givers of peace, vide Shatapath 3-9-4-16. Swami</xml>
<xml>Dayananda has translated it as givers of knowledge and wealth.</xml>
<xml>14. Agni may mean God as well. The mantra will then be interpreted thus. O God,</xml>
<xml>Thou art ever wakeful, but we are sleeping in ignorance. Protect us unceasingly. Awake</xml>
<xml>us again and again for the acquisition of true knowledge. Agni may mean Pran i.e., vital</xml>
<xml>breaths. Pran also is wakeful while all other senses go to sleep. These vital breaths protect</xml>
<xml>us, and restore us consciousness after t-leep.</xml>
<xml>15. Man regrets after rebirth and the creation of the universe , his physical and mental</xml>
<xml>faculties. This mantra clearly demonstrates the doctrine of th; Transmigration of soul, and</xml>
<xml>the creation of the universe-after each cycle, Kalpa.</xml>
<xml>16. Agni can be interpreted as fire as well. The second interpretation with Agai</xml>
<xml>meaning fire has been given by Swami Dayananda in his commentary. The mantra is clear, with</xml>
<xml>Agni substituted for fire in place of God.</xml>
<xml>18. Shwatra means both speech and lightning.</xml>
<xml>IV 4</xml>
<xml>19. O Speech, thou art thought, mind, intelligence, giver of</xml>
<xml>knowledge and victory ; thou art power, worthy of worship, immortal, and</xml>
<xml>double-headed. May thou give us comfort in the past and future. May</xml>
<xml>breath, the strength giving friend of time advance thee in knowledge,</xml>
<xml>and guard thy pathways for God, whose eye is over all.</xml>
<xml>20. O man, may thy mother, thy father, thy own brother, and</xml>
<xml>thy friend of the same society grant thee leave to tread on the path</xml>
<xml>ordained by God.</xml>
<xml>O speech, for the acquisition of splendour, may thou unite with</xml>
<xml>God, the Prompter of all. May the Celibate student choose thee.</xml>
<xml>May thou, O man, happily acquire again and again this speech, the</xml>
<xml>friend of the learned.</xml>
<xml>21. O speech, thou art all-pervading, eternal, lustrous, sublime and</xml>
<xml>pleasant. The learned person uses thee for happiness. The sage, the</xml>
<xml>chastiser of the wicked longs for thee along with other educated persons.</xml>
<xml>22. O speech, I use thee in the heights of sky and the sacri-</xml>
<xml>ficial places on the Earth. Thou art the preserver of vedic verses. May</xml>
<xml>thou be enriched with high knowledge. May thou rest in us. May thou</xml>
<xml>be united to us. Thou art rich. May I be full of riches. Let us not be</xml>
<xml>deprived of abundant riches. May splendour reside in thee full of</xml>
<xml>understanding.</xml>
<xml>23. O speech, I praise thee with divine, ignorance-removing and</xml>
<xml>penetrating intelligence. End not my life. I will not through ignorance</xml>
<xml>spoil thee. O vedic text, in thy protection, may I be blessed with</xml>
<xml>heroism.</xml>
<xml>19. Speech has been spoken of as double headed, as its one part gives us the knowledge</xml>
<xml>of external objects, and the other part of internal ones ; or speech makes us cognisant of internal</xml>
<xml>pain and pleasure and external occurrences ; or the external organs like eyes etc. represent its</xml>
<xml>one face, and the internal organ, the mind, the other.</xml>
<xml>^JSltft and 'yytfW may also mean that speech helps us in mastering the external problems</xml>
<xml>that come before us, and solving the subtle questionings of the soul.</xml>
<xml>Mitra may also mean the soul, which binds the speech to God, (<jft) as it is through the</xml>
<xml>persuasion of our soul, that we sing the glory and praises of God. 3TSFT: means the path of</xml>
<xml>knowledge and yoga which leads us to God. There is another interpretation as well of this</xml>
<xml>mantra, with lightning fot^ instead of speech 3Tft as its devata.</xml>
<xml>22. The sacrificial places mean the places where the wise and the learned perform</xml>
<xml>yajnas on this earth by the recitation of vedic verses.</xml>
<xml>Speech is the protector and preserver of the vedic verse*, as by their recitation and</xml>
<xml>memorisation they are preserved.</xml>
<xml>23, A king prays for strength,</xml>
<xml>50 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>24. O learned person "This is thy share of the sacrifice allied</xml>
<xml>with Gayatri verses" so may he say unto me a student of science. This</xml>
<xml>is thy share of the sacrifice allied with Trishtup verses/ so may he say</xml>
<xml>unto me, the seeker of the essence of things. This is thy share of the</xml>
<xml>sacrifice allied with verses in Jagati metre/ so may he say unto me a</xml>
<xml>student of science. 'May thou attain to sovereignty detailed in vedic-</xml>
<xml>verses in all other metres/ May he thus preach the art of kingship</xml>
<xml>unto me, full of affluence, O learned persons, just as ye are our purifying</xml>
<xml>preachers, so am I your worthy disciple, endowed with virtues and</xml>
<xml>wealth. May ye develop me and this sacrifice (yajna) as well.</xml>
<xml>25. I adore God, the Creator of the Earth and Sky, the Source of all</xml>
<xml>Knowledge, the Embodiment of Splendour, the Sustainer of all the</xml>
<xml>beautiful planets, the Centre of love, the object of praise by the Vedas,</xml>
<xml>and their Revealer. His lofty effulgent Self is divulged in the created</xml>
<xml>world. He has fixed the bright sun and the moon in their conduct. He</xml>
<xml>is the wisest Actor. His mercy grants us happiness. O God I worship</xml>
<xml>Thee as Bestower of happiness on mankind. May all mortals enjoy life,</xml>
<xml>through Thee. May Thou grant life to all human beings.</xml>
<xml>26. In the yajna, we should please the learned performer by</xml>
<xml>offering him cash and kind. May the praiseworthy brilliance of the sun</xml>
<xml>make me strong through its thousandfold abundance. O wise person,</xml>
<xml>may we also obtain the riches, which thou hast secured through thy rule</xml>
<xml>over the earth. Just as I accomplish the sacrifice through noble, pure</xml>
<xml>sentiments, earn gold with gold, attain to salvation through immortal</xml>
<xml>knowledge, so may thou.</xml>
<xml>27. O king, famous for eloquence, brilliance, enmity to fraud,</xml>
<xml>antagonism to the thoughtless, pleasing manners, dexterity, defeating the</xml>
<xml>designs of the ill-minded, friendship, and the art of befriending others,</xml>
<xml>with longing for delight, come into us.</xml>
<xml>May thou, with a beautiful and healthy body, and endowed with all</xml>
<xml>cherished objects, enjoy enviable happiness. These intelligent and faith-</xml>
<xml>full subjects and servants, who all round protect you, should be protected</xml>
<xml>by you to ward off your enemy from doing injury unto you.</xml>
<xml>24. A learned person asks another learned person 'What is the share of the sacrifice</xml>
<xml>allied with vedic verses in Gayatri, Trishtup and Jagati metres. His answer is embodied in</xml>
<xml>this mantra 'He' refers to the learned person. Vedic verses in different metres like Gayatri,</xml>
<xml>Trishtup, Jagati and Ushnik etc. are recited during the performance of a yajna.</xml>
<xml>Ft. Jai Chand, Vidya Alankar of Ajmere, has in his commentary translated Gayatri as</xml>
<xml>alluding to the Brahmanas, Trishtupa to the Kshatriyas and Jagati to the Vaishas.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER IV 51</xml>
<xml>28. Oh God, dissuade me from sin, and establish me firmly in</xml>
<xml>righteousness. May I enjoy the pleasures of final beatitude by leading a</xml>
<xml>long and virtuous life.</xml>
<xml>29. May we tread the path free from sin, and full of delight, by</xml>
<xml>which a wise man overcomes all carnal pleasures, and gathers wealth.</xml>
<xml>30. O God, Thou art the protector of the Earth, O Mighty Lord,</xml>
<xml>Thou fixed the Earth in its Orbit. Thou Controllest the Sun. Thou</xml>
<xml>hast created the beautiful sky. O Lord of all, thou fixest in space all</xml>
<xml>the worlds. All these are the works of Him alone, so do we know.</xml>
<xml>31. We should worship God, who hast created the sky over the</xml>
<xml>forests, put speed in horses, milk in cows, intellect in hearts, gastric juice</xml>
<xml>in men, sun in heaven, and medicinal plants like Soma in the mountains.</xml>
<xml>32. O God, where resplendent through Thy qualities of knowledge,</xml>
<xml>Thou art known by the learned, and where Thou Greatest lustrous eyes,</xml>
<xml>the instruments for seeing the sun and fire, there we worship Thee.</xml>
<xml>33. Let man and woman, who study the vedas kill not their</xml>
<xml>heroes, are limited in resources, be ever joyous, who live together and</xml>
<xml>are fit to bear the burden of domestic life, be united together in married</xml>
<xml>life. May such couples visit the houses of religious persons and give</xml>
<xml>them happiness.</xml>
<xml>34. O learned man, the Lord of Earth, thou art my gracious</xml>
<xml>helper. Fly happily to all the stations in our well overhauled aeroplane.</xml>
<xml>Doing so, let not thieves, robbers, and malignant opponents meet thee.</xml>
<xml>Fall like a falcon upon such foes. Go to the houses of religious persons,</xml>
<xml>situated in distant parts of the world.</xml>
<xml>30. The Mantra can similarly be interpreted for sun and air instead of God. Maharshi</xml>
<xml>Dftyananda has given two interpretations to this verse, one for God, and the other for sun and</xml>
<xml>air.</xml>
<xml>31. The creation of the sky over mountains means the pouring of rain over them for</xml>
<xml>their growth.</xml>
<xml>32. God is universal and ubiquitous so He should be worshipped everywhere. He has</xml>
<xml>created everywhere the sun, fire, and eyes, and so He is adorable by us at all places.</xml>
<xml>33. Mahidhar and Ubbat have referred this mantra to a pair of oxen. Maharshi</xml>
<xml>Dayananda uses SRJ^in place of 3R^ the usual text as observed in al I edition**. *H5^ has been</xml>
<xml>translated by Rishi Dayananda 3l3Slfa^i.e., limited. Mahidhar translates Uff^ as those who</xml>
<xml>weep not.</xml>
<xml>34. In this verse, we are instructed to construct aeroplanes, and visit thereby the</xml>
<xml>distant places of the world, add to our wealth by commerce, keep our foes away, and lead a</xml>
<xml>happy and comfortable life,,</xml>
<xml>52 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>35. Do homage unto God, the Friend of all, Ever Pure, and Res-</xml>
<xml>plendent. Worship the true nature of the Mighty God. Sing praises</xml>
<xml>unto God, the Purifier of all radiant objects, the Omniscient, the Embodi-</xml>
<xml>ment of virtues, and the Exhibitor of distant objects.</xml>
<xml>36. O God, Thou art the Director of this fine world ; the Creator</xml>
<xml>of objects dependable on air, and the Force inherent in the sun for the</xml>
<xml>motion of waters, the stay and support of all excellent objects. O Lord,</xml>
<xml>Thou makest us reach the destination of true and high knowledge.</xml>
<xml>37. O God, just as learned persons, utilize Thy created objects by</xml>
<xml>Oblations, so should we utilize all of them. Thy Yajna is the advancer</xml>
<xml>of our progeny, wealth and houses, dispeller of diseases, bestower of</xml>
<xml>heroes, remover of the idlers and cowards from amongst us, and giver of</xml>
<xml>happiness in manifold ways, may that conduce to our benefit. O learned</xml>
<xml>persons, may ye perform this yajna, and live happily in your houses.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER V</xml>
<xml>1. Oh oblation, thou art the body of fire, I accept thee for the com-</xml>
<xml>pletion of sacrifice. Thou art the material of all the created objects in</xml>
<xml>the universe, I use thee for the purification of air. Thou art the source</xml>
<xml>of reception of the unexpected guest, I accept thee for the acquisition of</xml>
<xml>knowledge. Thou art fast in speed like the falcon, I put thee into the</xml>
<xml>fire, I accept thee, the source of happiness for the learned and active</xml>
<xml>worshipper. I accept thee as giver of wealth, knowledge, action and all</xml>
<xml>noble qualities.</xml>
<xml>2 O Yajna, thou art the creator of fire. Ye (sun and air) are the</xml>
<xml>cause of rain. Thou art the source of manifold comforts, the giver of</xml>
<xml>life, and the instrument for preaching the shastras.</xml>
<xml>O fire I kindle thee with the verses in Gayatri metre, with the</xml>
<xml>verses in Trishtup metre, and with the verses in Jagati metre.</xml>
<xml>3. O teacher and disciple, be ye for us of the same one thought,</xml>
<xml>free from sin, and conversant with the knowledge of the vedas. Harm</xml>
<xml>not the sacrifice, harm not the sacrifice's lord, the worshipper. Be kind</xml>
<xml>to us this day.</xml>
<xml>4. The learned disciple of the experts in vedic lore, the protector</xml>
<xml>against violence, the master of the science of electricity, the giver of</xml>
<xml>pleasure, the expositor of the different branches of knowledge, and the</xml>
<xml>enemy of indolence, enjoys life happily. He, endowed with noble quali-</xml>
<xml>ties, grants us in this world knowledge and provisions for performing</xml>
<xml>Havan. Let us go to such a man.</xml>
<xml>5. O God, Thou art my Protector against violence. I take Thee as</xml>
<xml>my Sovereign Lord, as the Guardian in all directions, as the Giver of</xml>
<xml>sound body, as the Embodiment of strength, and the Securer of valiant</xml>
<xml>soldiers.</xml>
<xml>Through God's grace, may I easily attain to truth and invincible,</xml>
<xml>irresistible, inviolate and invulnerable strength of the learned. Set me</xml>
<xml>O God on the path of virtue.</xml>
<xml>1. The performance of Havan, by means of fft: 'oblation* of clarified butter and</xml>
<xml>'provisions 1 contributes to our wisdom, knowledge, activity and good qualities.</xml>
<xml>2. Verses in Gayatri, Trishtup and Jagati metres are recited when fire is ignited in a</xml>
<xml>yajna.</xml>
<xml>5. This mantra has been interpreted by Swami Dayananda Saraswati for lightning ai</xml>
<xml>54 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>6. O God, Thou art the Guardian of religious vows, may I be com-</xml>
<xml>petent to fulfil my vows under Thy guidance. May Thy vast power rule</xml>
<xml>over me, and may my power remain under Thee. O Protector of the</xml>
<xml>vedas, may our pledge of continence be fulfilled in toto. May the Lord of</xml>
<xml>Consecration, persuade me for initiation. May the Lord of penance induce</xml>
<xml>me to take a vow of austerity.</xml>
<xml>7. O resplendent God, may Thy each pervading force advance the</xml>
<xml>glorious soul, that longs for the sole wealth of knowledge. May the soul</xml>
<xml>glorify Thee, may Thou advance the soul. May Thou, Friend to all,</xml>
<xml>advance us by means of God-reaching intelligence. O Mighty God, May</xml>
<xml>I attain with pleasure to Thy beatitude.</xml>
<xml>May we obtain the longed-for wealth for food and success. Let us</xml>
<xml>receive truth from those whose speech is truthful. Let as receive food</xml>
<xml>from Heaven and Earth.</xml>
<xml>8. O fire, thy force which is present in metals like gold, in all the</xml>
<xml>spheres like the sun and in lightning; is vast and deep. It creates an</xml>
<xml>awful and formidable sound ; and is powerful to emit invigorating utter-</xml>
<xml>ances. That force is present in every object.</xml>
<xml>9. O fire, for me thou art the home of all fixed objects. For me</xml>
<xml>thou art the gathering place of wealth. Protect me from dictatorship.</xml>
<xml>Protect me from fear.</xml>
<xml>May physical fire attain to water in the space. May fire with the</xml>
<xml>names of Angira and Ayu approach us. The fire which is in the Earth,</xml>
<xml>I kindle with its inviolate, holy lustre in the yajna.</xml>
<xml>May physical fire attain to water in the space. May fire with the</xml>
<xml>names of Angira and Ayu approach us. The fire which is in the space,</xml>
<xml>I kindle with its inviolate, holy lustre in the yajna.</xml>
<xml>May physical fire attain to water in the space. May fire with the</xml>
<xml>names of Angira and Ayu approach us. The fire which is in the sky,</xml>
<xml>I kindle with its inviolate, holy lustre in the yajna.</xml>
<xml>May we utilize the sacrificial fire for the acquisition of good</xml>
<xml>qualities.</xml>
<xml>10. O speech, thou pronouncest words and overawest foes, attain to</xml>
<xml>the learned. O speech, thou art the dispeller of ignorance, and remover</xml>
<xml>6. *ft (Our) refers to the vows of celibacy and cootinaoce taken by the teacher and the</xml>
<xml>disciple. JftQT means initiation into a sacred vow.</xml>
<xml>9. Fire is named Angira, as it pervades all the organs of the body. It is named Ayu,</xml>
<xml>as it is the giver of heat and life. Without it there can be no life or existence.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER V 55</xml>
<xml>of evils, purify the religious-minded people. O speech, thou art the</xml>
<xml>destroyer of ignoble character and the subduer of mean demeanour,</xml>
<xml>aborn thyself for the well-behaved learned persons.</xml>
<xml>11. O speech, may the teaching of God's revealed vedas, protect</xml>
<xml>thee in the east with Vasu Brahmcharis, may the highly intellectual people</xml>
<xml>guard thee in the west with the Rudra Brahmcharis ; may the deep</xml>
<xml>thinkers protect thee in the south with the wise, may the learned</xml>
<xml>persons guard thee in the north with Aditya Bramcharis.</xml>
<xml>Let us banish from our sacrifice, i.e., soul and body, the hot un-</xml>
<xml>healthy water, anger, anxiety and anguish.</xml>
<xml>12. O speech, thou art the dispeller of ignorance. O speech,</xml>
<xml>hallowed by astronomy, remover of the weakness of ferocity, thou des-</xml>
<xml>cribest the twelve months of the year. Thou, attained to by the seekers</xml>
<xml>after God and the vedas, by the heroes expert in military science, art</xml>
<xml>the remover of unwisdom. Thou art the remover of thieves and robbers,</xml>
<xml>and the giver of noble offspring, and abundant wealth. Thou art the</xml>
<xml>killer of all miseries. Endowed with knowledge, thou makest the</xml>
<xml>worshipper obtain good qualities.</xml>
<xml>I utilise thee through sacrifice (yajna) for the good of humanity.</xml>
<xml>13. Oh learned people ye should develop the yajna. which is firm</xml>
<xml>and develops the objects residing on the earth, which confers happiness</xml>
<xml>and imparts the knowledge of sacred lore and develops the dwellers in</xml>
<xml>the air, which affords shelter to indestructible objects, and diffuses</xml>
<xml>knowledge ; which replenishes lightning and the beasts.</xml>
<xml>14. The sages, who consecrate their soul to Him, concentrate</xml>
<xml>their mind and intellect upon God, who is Omnipresent, Omnipotent, and</xml>
<xml>Omniscient. They sing His praises in various ways. He is the sole</xml>
<xml>Knower of all good acts, and self-existing. Great is the praise of Him,</xml>
<xml>the Creator and Seer of all. He is the preacher of Truth.</xml>
<xml>15. He who pervades the animate and the inanimate worlds, has</xml>
<xml>11. Speech means vedic text</xml>
<xml>12. Just as the science of astronomy explains the creation of the twelve months of the</xml>
<xml>year by the motion of heavenly bodies, so does speech describe the creation, and climatic</xml>
<xml>nature of these twelve months.</xml>
<xml>13. The yajna contributes to the growth of inmates of the earth and air by purifying</xml>
<xml>the air and water and growing corns and grass for the use of men and animals. It adds to</xml>
<xml>our knowledge by the recitation of the Vedic texts which accompany it.</xml>
<xml>15. ifw may refer to Satva, Rajas and Tamas. Gcd exhibits his might in the world in</xml>
<xml>these three forms. It may also refer to earth, air and sky. It may also refer to sun full of</xml>
<xml>brightness, to earth devoid of light, and minute atoms.</xml>
<xml>56 YAJUR</xml>
<xml>created the visible and invisible worlds, and has established His dignity in</xml>
<xml>three ways. His invisible form is hidden in the space. He is worthy of</xml>
<xml>worship by all.</xml>
<xml>16. O, Omnipresent God, Thou preservest on all sides, with know-</xml>
<xml>ledge, this earth, rich in nice food, rich in good milch-kine, and full of</xml>
<xml>elements and compounds. Thou preservest the vedic speech and the</xml>
<xml>created-world. We all implore for the whole world to Him, who is</xml>
<xml>All-knowing and chastiser.</xml>
<xml>17. O man and woman, having acquired knowledge from the learned,</xml>
<xml>proclaim amongst the wise the fact of your intention of entering the</xml>
<xml>married life. Attain to fame, observing the noble virtue of non-violence,</xml>
<xml>and uplift your soul. Shun crookedness. Converse together happily.</xml>
<xml>Living in a peaceful home, spoil not your life, spoil not your progeny. In</xml>
<xml>this world, pass your life happily, on this wide earth full of enjoyment.</xml>
<xml>18. I describe the mighty deeds of Omnipresent God, Who unifies</xml>
<xml>the different parts of the physical cause of the universe, Who preaches</xml>
<xml>all truths through the Vedas, Who creates the three-fold worlds in the</xml>
<xml>space, Who keeps under His control matter the highest cause, and Who</xml>
<xml>is resorted to for worship. O God, I hastily seek Thy shelter, Who is</xml>
<xml>Ever-Blissful.</xml>
<xml>19. O Omnipresent God, fill both of our hands with riches from all</xml>
<xml>sources like electricity, earth, and vast wide air's mid-region. Grant us</xml>
<xml>pleasures from the right and the left. We worship Thee for the know-</xml>
<xml>ledge of yoga.</xml>
<xml>20. God, in whose three-fold world reside all created objects, is</xml>
<xml>praised for His power, like a dceadful, mountain-roaming tiger, that kills</xml>
<xml>the despicable beings. He punishes the sinners, and preaches to all the</xml>
<xml>vedic knowledge.</xml>
<xml>21. O World thou art created by God, O animate and inanimate</xml>
<xml>objects ye are the two-fold pure .powers of God, O Air, thou art wide-</xml>
<xml>spread through God's strength. O soul, thou art ever immortal through</xml>
<xml>20. This verse means, just as a lion keeps under his control other beasts, so does God</xml>
<xml>regulate all the created worlds. The adjectives used in the verse are applicable to God aa</xml>
<xml>well. He is ijiT : as he controls all living being*. He is ifta* as all men are afraid of Him.</xml>
<xml>He is f^SK: as He chastises all the sinful and wicked people. He is flrffar. as He is sung and</xml>
<xml>praised in the vedas. SR3, TSffi and flTTO are the three-fold varieties of creation, or Earth,</xml>
<xml>Sky and Space, constitute the three-fold world in which all living creatures have their</xml>
<xml>habitation.</xml>
<xml>21. In this verto a learned man speaks to an ordinary person to follow him, and do at</xml>
<xml>he does.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER V 57</xml>
<xml>God's grace. O complete universe, thou art created by God. O man I</xml>
<xml>ordain thee to worship the All-pervading God.</xml>
<xml>22. O man, just as I perform the sacrifice fyajna) in this world of</xml>
<xml>God, the Creator of the universe, by the force and strength of vital</xml>
<xml>breaths, and the earth's power of attraction and retention, so do thou.</xml>
<xml>Just as I observe the details of the performance of the sacrifice, so do thou.</xml>
<xml>Just as I cut the necks of the sinners and punish them, so do thou. Just</xml>
<xml>as I through this yajna, attain to eminence, and become a big preacher</xml>
<xml>of the vedas, so do thou. Just as I preach to the king the lofty teachings</xml>
<xml>of the vedas. so do thou.</xml>
<xml>23. O learned man, just as I with the aid of vedic speech, the</xml>
<xml>Killer of fiends and infuser of strength, perform the invigorating</xml>
<xml>sacrifice, so do thou. Just as my wise, and able man, expert in the</xml>
<xml>science of yajna, performs the sacrifice or unearths this place to test it</xml>
<xml>geologically, so shouldst do thy man.</xml>
<xml>Just as I a geologist resort to strength-giving agriculture and the</xml>
<xml>science of geology, so do thou. Just as my equal and unequal man</xml>
<xml>geologically digs a place, so shouldst do thy man. Just as I a learner and</xml>
<xml>teacher, perform the sacrifice, the giver of soul-force or practise this act</xml>
<xml>of reading and teaching, so do thou. Just as my similar or dissimilar</xml>
<xml>companion regularly performs this sacrifice so shouldst do thine.</xml>
<xml>Just as I, the friend of all, perform this yajna, the giver of kindly</xml>
<xml>power, or have recourse to the science of geology, so do thou.</xml>
<xml>Just as my contemporary or non-contemporary performs this noble</xml>
<xml>deed, so shouldst ever do thine.</xml>
<xml>Just as I perform noble and virtuous deeds, so do thou.</xml>
<xml>24. O king, thou art self-effulgent, hence thou art the conqueror</xml>
<xml>23. Swami Day ananda translates Rmf^ as infuser of strength, Ubbat and Mahidhar</xml>
<xml>translate the word as the killer or remover of I5HT I ttft is translated as bones, hair, and nails</xml>
<xml>buried in the ground as magic to do injury to an opponent. This verse is interpreted for</xml>
<xml>digging out and removing that magical charm. A story has been coined by Mahidhar, that</xml>
<xml>the Rakshsaa were defeated by Indra, and they buried the magical charm i.e., WSfTT underneath</xml>
<xml>the ground one hand deep. To me this interpretation appears irrational, as the vedas are</xml>
<xml>free from historical references, being the eternal word of God, given to mankind in the begin-</xml>
<xml>ning of creation.</xml>
<xml>Swami Dayananda rightly interprets ^WI3HH as forceful vedic speech. The underlying</xml>
<xml>spirit of the verse is that one should follow the rule of conduct of the learned and not the</xml>
<xml>ignorant.</xml>
<xml>fWR? means equal in wealth, position and knowledge and IIWJH: are those who differ</xml>
<xml>in these things.</xml>
<xml>58 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>of foes. Thou art renowned in sacrifices, hence thou art the subduef</xml>
<xml>of the proud enemies. Man's ruler art thou, hence thou art the slaye*</xml>
<xml>of fiends. All ruler art thou, hence thou art the killer of foes.</xml>
<xml>25. O members of an Assembly, just as ye are the removers of</xml>
<xml>miseries, so I, the diffuser of the force of foes, having paid my homage</xml>
<xml>to ye, devoted people, set right these proud people by arms in the battle.</xml>
<xml>Just as ye are the killers of the sinners, so I, the scanner of the forces</xml>
<xml>of the enemy, having made ye, devoted people, comfortable, turn aside</xml>
<xml>the ignoble people. Just as I, the arranger of the troops indifferent</xml>
<xml>orders, fill with ease, ye, the destroyers of foes and performers of sacri-</xml>
<xml>fices, so do ye. Just as ye the killers of foes and acquirers of strength,</xml>
<xml>receive the worshipper and the learned priest, so do I. Just as ye the</xml>
<xml>destroyers of foes, and acquirers of strength, know through reasoning</xml>
<xml>the ways of the learned, and the knowledge pertaining to God, so should</xml>
<xml>I. Just as ye all are worshippers of All pervading God, so am I.</xml>
<xml>26. O learned man, in this world created by the happinsss-bestow-</xml>
<xml>ing God, I receive thee with the force and strength of vital breaths, and</xml>
<xml>the arm and power of punishment of a fully developed hero.</xml>
<xml>Protecting this world, I behead the sinners, Thou hast the power</xml>
<xml>of imparting virtue and removing vice. Remove from us our haters and</xml>
<xml>enemies. For the exposition of Truth, for flying in air, for consolidating</xml>
<xml>our material forces, we seek thy refuge.</xml>
<xml>This is the abode of the learned. May all who reside near them</xml>
<xml>make themselves pure. O woman thou also behave likewise.</xml>
<xml>27. O highly learned man, just as air with its definite strength,</xml>
<xml>and vital breaths moves thee, so kindly discriminate for us the light of</xml>
<xml>knowledge from ignorance ; fill full the space, and preaching noble vir-</xml>
<xml>tues on Earth, strengthen delights. Strengthen the knowledge of the</xml>
<xml>Vedas, strengthen our kingdom, strengthen our age, aud strengthen our</xml>
<xml>offspring. I consider thee as the source of spiritual knowledge, earthly</xml>
<xml>power, and vast riches.</xml>
<xml>25. In this verse a learned man addresses the members of an assembly or Parliament.</xml>
<xml>The gist of this verse is that through the worship of God, having acquired physical and spiritual</xml>
<xml>strength, and subduing our foes, we should rule peacefully and calmly.</xml>
<xml>26. A king addresses a learned man in this verse. We should purify ourselves in the</xml>
<xml>company of the learned.</xml>
<xml>27. Here too a king addresses the learned person.</xml>
<xml>To fill the space full means to enable us to fly freely in the air.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER V 59</xml>
<xml>28. O wife of the worshipper, just as thou with thy offspring and</xml>
<xml>cattle, art firm in thy resolution, in this world ; so should this husband</xml>
<xml>of thine be determined in his purpose. Both of you should fill the</xml>
<xml>Heaven and Earth with fragrance of clarified butter.</xml>
<xml>Thou art the guardian of glory, and the shelter of all people.</xml>
<xml>29. O Adorable God, may all my praises be directed unto Thee.</xml>
<xml>O God, wise like the aged, may my lovable ever increasing praises be</xml>
<xml>soft and sweet.</xml>
<xml>30. O God, Thou unitest the soul with Thee, Thou art the re-</xml>
<xml>fuge of the soul, Thou art the friend of the soul. Thou art the receptacle</xml>
<xml>of all noble virtues.</xml>
<xml>31. O God Thou art Omnipresent, and fit to take the burden of</xml>
<xml>the world. Just as fire carries up in a rarefied form the articles put into</xml>
<xml>it, so dost Thou diffuse all knowledge. Thou art All-knowing, and</xml>
<xml>Thou Teacher of all, Thou art Omniscient, and Developer of wisdom.</xml>
<xml>32. O God, Thou art Effulgent, Wise, hostile to the sinners, ene-</xml>
<xml>my of thraldom, the Unifier and Protector of all. Thou art fit for service</xml>
<xml>by us. Thou art Pure and Purifier. Thou art a Just Ruler ; and the Prop of</xml>
<xml>the weak. Thou art adored in Assemblies. Thou art the Giver of holiness,</xml>
<xml>the Chastiser of thieves and robbers and Bestower of joy. Thou givest</xml>
<xml>us strength to endure pleasure and pain ; and grantest us splendour.</xml>
<xml>Thou art the abode of Truth, and Giver of lustre to the sky.</xml>
<xml>33. O God, Thy knowledge is fathomless. Thou art Omnipresent,</xml>
<xml>and Unborn. Thou boldest the universe with a part of Thy Energy.</xml>
<xml>Thou art the Master of all forms of knowledge ; and the Source of</xml>
<xml>Universe. Thou art the highest Teacher 5 and full of splendour, Thou</xml>
<xml>art the asylum of all. Ye two gates of knowledge do not distress me. O</xml>
<xml>Lord of religious paths, lead me onward, through religious ways. May I</xml>
<xml>be happy in this God-reaching path.</xml>
<xml>34. O learned persons full of knowledge and inculcations, look</xml>
<xml>28. Husband and wife are asked to perform the yajna daily, and fill the heaven and</xml>
<xml>earth with the fragrant smell of ghee used in it.</xml>
<xml>,33. qqntf^ may also mean, the one and sole protector. The two gates of knowledge are</xml>
<xml>external and internal happiness, i.e., physical and mental ease. If one's physical health</xml>
<xml>is lost, he can't advance his knowledge, and same is the case when one's mental peace is</xml>
<xml>disturbed. These are the two sources for the acquisition of knowledge. A devotee prays</xml>
<xml>for physical and mental health. Lord of religious path is the learned person who shows</xml>
<xml>the true path. God -reach ing path is the path of salvation, on which the wise and th$</xml>
<xml>learned tread.</xml>
<xml>60 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>upon me with the eye of a friend. May ye preach knowledge. O learned</xml>
<xml>people protect me with your air-force and renowned army, that make</xml>
<xml>the enemy weep. O learned person fill me with wisdom and virtues,</xml>
<xml>and guard me on all sides. Unto thee be my adoration. Do not</xml>
<xml>injure me.</xml>
<xml>35. O Splendid God, Thou art the light and fine illuminator of</xml>
<xml>all the learned persons. Thou art the controller of the sins committed</xml>
<xml>by us and others, and those who practise hatred. Let the man possess-</xml>
<xml>ing a fine home, good speech and vast knowledge know the vedas.</xml>
<xml>36. O God, the Master of all, and the Giver of all kinds of</xml>
<xml>happiness, and the knower of all of our actions and thoughts, lead us to</xml>
<xml>salvation through the path of virtue. Keep away from us all crooked</xml>
<xml>sins. We offer Thee most ample obeisance.</xml>
<xml>37. May this General, the queller of the sinners like fire, give us</xml>
<xml>protection. This General expert in military skill, should in the battle</xml>
<xml>first attack and subdue the wicked foes. May he win all wars. May he</xml>
<xml>conquer foes. May he come out successful in combats, issuing necessary</xml>
<xml>administrative orders.</xml>
<xml>38. O General, attack the enemy with full force > and give ample</xml>
<xml>room for our abode. O learned General, just as fire assimilates ghee and</xml>
<xml>burns brightly -, so shouldst thou develop thy virtues and shine in battles.</xml>
<xml>Just as priests protecting the worshipper make him overcome all</xml>
<xml>calamities, so shouldst thou with thy oratory win battles.</xml>
<xml>39. O learned person, the propagator of all kinds of knowledge</xml>
<xml>and full of splendour, this is thy glory, protect it, let jtione harm thee.</xml>
<xml>O king, the giver of happiness, and leader of men on the path of virtue,</xml>
<xml>and hence well established in the diffusion of knowledge, go thou to the</xml>
<xml>sages. Abiding by this advice, just as I deliver the wise persons from</xml>
<xml>the noose of the despicable knaves ; so shouldst thou.</xml>
<xml>40. O learned teacher, thou art the guardian of my vow. Let thy</xml>
<xml>vast knowledge be mine. Let my learning be subordinate to thee. Let</xml>
<xml>my wisdom depend upon thine. O Lord of vows, let our vows of noble</xml>
<xml>conduct be accomplished friendly. O lord of initiation, teach me truth.</xml>
<xml>O lord of austerity, teach me to lead an austere life.</xml>
<xml>39. The verse is a kind of dialogue between a learned person and a king* The</xml>
<xml>learned person advises a king to seek the company of the learned, and the king replies that</xml>
<xml>he protects the wise and the learned from the baneful influence of the wicked parson*.</xml>
<xml>40. The disciple addresses the teacher. Our refers to the disciple and the Guru.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER V 61</xml>
<xml>41. O learned person, mayest thou be conversant with all branches</xml>
<xml>of knowledge, for the vast development of learning. Give us happiness.</xml>
<xml>Drink thou the water, the precursor of whifch is lightning. Just as I</xml>
<xml>make the worshipper overcome all obstacles, so shouldst thou be totally</xml>
<xml>free from all ills, by the regular performance of Havan.</xml>
<xml>42* O learned botanist, just as thou shun nest the foolish and</xml>
<xml>seekest the company of the wise, so may I avoid the company of the</xml>
<xml>enemies of the wise, and go to the wise. May I approach thee more</xml>
<xml>learned among the learned but the humblest among the humble. Just as</xml>
<xml>the learned long for thee for the acquisition of good qualities, so do I.</xml>
<xml>Just as medicinal herbs, rendered fit for the yajna protect all, so do we</xml>
<xml>for sacrifce hail thee, the remover of diseases, and the assuager of</xml>
<xml>affliction.</xml>
<xml>O learned person, just as I do not want to spoil this yajna, so</xml>
<xml>shouldst thou not*</xml>
<xml>43. Just as I gaze not at the sun, so shouldst thou not. Just as I</xml>
<xml>disturb not the proper arrangement of things, so shouldst thou not. Just</xml>
<xml>as I live on the earth in a spirit of friendliness towards all, so shouldst</xml>
<xml>thou.</xml>
<xml>As a well-sharpened axe, gives splendour by the removal of enemies,</xml>
<xml>so may this grant thee glory.</xml>
<xml>O happy learned person, the master of forests, may thy dynasty</xml>
<xml>increase, just as a tree does with its hundred roots. May our progeny</xml>
<xml>increase in numbers, just as a tree does with its manifold boughs.</xml>
<xml>41. A priest addresses a learned person. Lightning flashes before it begins to rain.</xml>
<xml>It is the precursor of rain. Rain-water is the purest form of water. This verse is identical</xml>
<xml>with verse thirtyeight of this chapter. The charge of repetition is unfounded as both the</xml>
<xml>verses have different meanings.</xml>
<xml>42. A disciple addresses a teacher ; or a seeker after knowledge addresses a learned</xml>
<xml>person*</xml>
<xml>43. This is a dialogue between a learned person and a worshipper.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER VI</xml>
<xml>1. O king, just as the wise and aged persons, in this world, created</xml>
<xml>by the Effulgent God, accept thee, with the force and strength of vital</xml>
<xml>breaths, and attraction and retention of breath, the source of strength ;</xml>
<xml>so do I.</xml>
<xml>Just as I cut the throats of the sinners, so shouldst thou.</xml>
<xml>Oking, thou hast the power of imparting virtue and removing vice,</xml>
<xml>remove from us our despisers and foes.</xml>
<xml>Just as I sanctify thee, the exponent of justice, for the display of</xml>
<xml>knowledge, thee, the embodiment of truth, for spiritual advancement }</xml>
<xml>thee, the administrator, for rule over the Earth ; so should these justice-</xml>
<xml>loving people do.</xml>
<xml>O king thou art a father unto thine subjects, rear them up.</xml>
<xml>O Queen, thou also shouldst behave similarly.</xml>
<xml>2. O king, thou art our leader ; thou putteth upon the path of</xml>
<xml>rectitude, even the leaders of a high order. Know thou this art of</xml>
<xml>government.</xml>
<xml>God the creator will rule over thee. Just as the state officials</xml>
<xml>anoint thee with sweet juices and flower-laden herbs, so should the</xml>
<xml>subjects do.</xml>
<xml>Thy first duty is to undertake the spread of knowledge and the</xml>
<xml>administration of justice.</xml>
<xml>Thy second duty is to propagate religious truths. Thy foremost</xml>
<xml>duty is to strengthen thy rule over the Earth.</xml>
<xml>3. O king we desire to reach all thy abodes, where the resplendent</xml>
<xml>beams of adorable God's knowledge spread far and wide.</xml>
<xml>In those very places, have the sages attained to the highest bliss</xml>
<xml>of God.</xml>
<xml>1. This verse is exactly similar to 5.26. The objection of repetition does not arise, as the</xml>
<xml>Devatas and meanings of both the verses are different. The former is addressed to a general,</xml>
<xml>the latter describes the qualities, an Acharya ought to preach to a king at the time of his</xml>
<xml>coronation.</xml>
<xml>3. A learned person preaches to a king. The king should arrange for such calm, quiet,</xml>
<xml>healthy and comfortable places , whert the learned may resort to for peaceful meditation</xml>
<xml>of God.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER VI 63</xml>
<xml>I consider thee as the source of spiritual knowledge, e&ithly power,</xml>
<xml>and vast riches.</xml>
<xml>Advance the knowledge of the vedas, improve thy rule and military</xml>
<xml>experts, prolong thy life, and advance thy progeny.</xml>
<xml>4. O men study God's works of Creation, preservation and dis-</xml>
<xml>solution of the universe ; whereby He determines His laws.</xml>
<xml>Each one of us is His close-allied friend.</xml>
<xml>5. The learned scholars of the vedas realise the lofty attributes of</xml>
<xml>God, as the extended eye gazes at the sun.</xml>
<xml>6. O king, thou art the repository of knowledge like a sage.</xml>
<xml>The learned subjects obey thee in all directions. May riches fit for</xml>
<xml>men be secured by this intelligent devotee. Thou art lustrous like the</xml>
<xml>beams of the sun.</xml>
<xml>May all people on the earth and all beasts of the forest be under</xml>
<xml>thy control.</xml>
<xml>7. O king, thou art the embodiment of noble qualities, and remover</xml>
<xml>of the miseries of thy subjects. Thou protectest those who take refuge</xml>
<xml>under thy shelter. May thy noble subjects be associated with learned</xml>
<xml>persons, full of splendour and efficient to undertake the responsibility</xml>
<xml>of government. Feel pleasure, and let thy subjects enjoy thy pleasurable</xml>
<xml>precious riches.</xml>
<xml>8. O rich sons, roam in knowledge and good training. O highly</xml>
<xml>learned teacher, please accept the honestly earned money, we offer thee.</xml>
<xml>O prince, thou art liked by the learned, I, a scholar of scriptures, release</xml>
<xml>thee from the bondage of ignorance, be steadfast and firm in the</xml>
<xml>acquisition of knowledge.</xml>
<xml>9. O disciple, in this world created by God, full of splendour, and</xml>
<xml>the Revealer of the Vedas, with the attributes of the Sun and moon, and</xml>
<xml>with the retention and gravitation of the Earth, namely its hands I</xml>
<xml>welcome thee. I lovingly initiate thee endowed with prosperity and</xml>
<xml>peace in the Brahmcharya Ashram sprinkling thee with water and corn.</xml>
<xml>8. In the first part of the verse the father addresses the sons and the teacher. In the</xml>
<xml>latter part the teacher addresses the disciple.</xml>
<xml>9. Uftpft: means the sun and moon. HtPQTOl means with qualities that work like arms.</xml>
<xml>This is a figurative use of the word. The qualities of lustre and prevention of evil of the son</xml>
<xml>and moon are referred to. Both give light, and conduce to our health and ward off diseases.</xml>
<xml>tffa ^fWtaTtHJ qftKTClfttio *-?. The qualities of retention and gravitation are figuratively</xml>
<xml>spoken of as earth's hands. In this verse the teacher addresses the pupil at the time of</xml>
<xml>the ceremony of investiture of the sacred thread (yajnopavit).</xml>
<xml>64 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>May thy mother, father, brother, friend and fellow students grani</xml>
<xml>thee permission for my discipleship.</xml>

<xml>10. O pupil, thou art the purifier of water through yajna. May</xml>
<xml>people purified by thy sacrifice enjoy pleasant waters, and substances</xml>
<xml>obtained by virtuous means, as do the sages.</xml>
<xml>Through my benediction, may all thy organs be devoted to the</xml>
<xml>performance of the yajna along with the learned priests.</xml>
<xml>May thy breath roam freely with the wind, and may thou be the</xml>
<xml>performer of the yajna of the spread of knowledge.</xml>
<xml>11. O performers of yajna and its supervisor fond of ghee as ye are,</xml>
<xml>rear cows. Let each one of you regulate by purifying all pervading air</xml>
<xml>the worshipper full of splendour, pleasure, born of wide space ; and</xml>
<xml>understand his primary aim. Perform duly yourself the yajna with all its</xml>
<xml>materials, and be one with the full observance of the details of the yajna.</xml>
<xml>O giver of happiness through yajna, welcome with sweet words all</xml>
<xml>the religious minded and learned persons who visit the yajna again and</xml>
<xml>again, and establish the worshipper in the pleasure-giving yajna.</xml>
<xml>12. O learned person, the diffuser of delight, behave not crookedly</xml>
<xml>like a serpent, or proudly like a fool, or ferociously like a tiger. Food is</xml>
<xml>ready for thee everywhere. Tread on the paths of truth and rectitude,</xml>
<xml>just as shelterless persons without any conveyance feel happy when they</xml>
<xml>teach a stream of water.</xml>
<xml>13. O girls, just as women, endowed with noble qualities, pure,</xml>
<xml>and highly educated are married to their deserving husbands, and serve</xml>
<xml>them faithfully ; and educated husbands are married to worthy wives, so</xml>
<xml>should ye be married ; and so shall we be joined in wedlock.</xml>
<xml>14. O disciple, through various sermons, I enjoin upon thee to purify</xml>
<xml>thy voice, thy breath, thy eye, tKy ear, thy navel, thy penis, thy anus ;</xml>
<xml>and all thy dealings.</xml>
<xml>15. O disciple, through my teaching, let thy mind be filled with</xml>

<xml>and strength like the wind.</xml>
<xml>14. The teacher addresses the student, advising him to keep all the organs of his body</xml>
<xml>and mind pure, healthy, and free from evil desires.</xml>
<xml>15. In the last portion of the verse the wife of the teacher addresses her husband and</xml>
<xml>he addresses her.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER VI 65</xml>
<xml>noble qualities, thy voice and breath be strong, thy eye clear in vision,</xml>
<xml>thy ear quick of hearing. Let thy evil designs be removed, and thy</xml>
<xml>intentions fulfilled. Let all thy doings be pure, and may thou daily</xml>
<xml>derive happiness.</xml>
<xml>O exalted teacher, guard this disciple, and spoil him not through</xml>
<xml>fondness and wrong teaching. O noble teacheress, protect this girl, and</xml>
<xml>chastise her not uselessly.</xml>
<xml>16. O sinner, demons pay homage unto thee. Get out ye evil</xml>
<xml>spirited. I stand before such a devil for dishonouring him, rather I</xml>
<xml>chastise such a despicable fellow with great disgust. I carry such a</xml>
<xml>satan to the lowest depth of distress. O disciple, the discriminator</xml>
<xml>between virtue and vice, and cultivator of goodness, understand all the</xml>
<xml>intricate problems, fill the Earth and Sun with water rendered pure</xml>
<xml>through thy yajna. Let the learned person know thy yajna performed</xml>
<xml>with clarified butter. Let the Earth and Sun filled with the greasy</xml>
<xml>substance of Homa attain to the air which carries up the water purified</xml>
<xml>by thy yajna.</xml>
<xml>17. Ye masters of knowledge, just as waters purify us, so do ye</xml>
<xml>wash away this indescribable sin and ignorance of mine. O learned</xml>
<xml>persons keep me away from the vice of false malice, and accusation of</xml>
<xml>the innocent. May noble, virtuous deed save me from sin.</xml>
<xml>18. O warlike hero, may thy mind in battle be filled with know-</xml>
<xml>ledge, and thy breath be united to life's force. O hero, thou art the</xml>
<xml>killer of foes. May the fire of righteous indignation created by battle</xml>
<xml>mature thee. Facing millions of the army of enemies, let not the heat</xml>
<xml>generated by battle disturb thee.</xml>
<xml>May thou get refreshing drinks to fight in war with the velocity</xml>
<xml>of wind, and speed of the sun.</xml>
<xml>19. Oh warriors, drinkers of water, drink refreshing water. O</xml>
<xml>warriors expert in statesmanship, follow the policy of heroic action.</xml>
<xml>O general, thou shouldst stop the foes in the air. With thy martial</xml>
<xml>and commanding voice spread thy soldiers in all regions, by-regions,</xml>
<xml>fore-regions, back-regions, and regions in which the enemy goes, and</xml>
<xml>conquer the foes, by slaying their warriors.</xml>
<xml>20. O destroyer of the strength of the enemy, O general endowed</xml>
<xml>with beautiful knowledge, shine forth in the battle-field subduing all</xml>
<xml>16. This verse condemns vice and upholds virtue. The disciple is advised by the</xml>
<xml>preceptor to purify water and air through the daily performance of yajna, spread them over</xml>
<xml>the Earth and send them up to the Sun.</xml>
<xml>66 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>thy foes, as the in-going breath pertaining to our soul, overcomes all</xml>
<xml>other breaths in every part of the body.</xml>
<xml>Just as Udsn breath permeates all our organs, so do thou O general</xml>
<xml>shine forth in the battle leading all your warriors. Let thy diverse</xml>
<xml>forces in uniform gather together in large numbers. O general, may all</xml>
<xml>warriors behave friendly towards thee for thy protection. May thy</xml>
<xml>mother, father and relatives be pleased to see thee moving in the midst</xml>
<xml>of warriors.</xml>
<xml>21. O disciple, a student in the science of government, sail in</xml>
<xml>oceans in steamers, fly in the air in aeroplanes, know God the Creator</xml>
<xml>through the vedas, control thy breath through yoga, through astronomy</xml>
<xml>know the functions of day and night, know all the Vedas, Rig, Yajur,</xml>
<xml>Sama, and Atharva, by means of their constituent parts.</xml>
<xml>Through astronomy, geography, and geology go thou to all the</xml>
<xml>different countries of the world under the sun. Mayest thou attain</xml>
<xml>through good preaching to statesmanship and artisanship, through medical</xml>
<xml>science obtain knowledge of all medicinal plants, through hydrostatics,</xml>
<xml>learn the different uses of water, through electricity understand the</xml>
<xml>working of ever-lustrous lightning. Carry out my instructions willingly.</xml>
<xml>May the smoke of thy yajna and military machines reach the sun, and</xml>
<xml>may their flames go up to heaven ; and may thou cover the earth with</xml>
<xml>the ashes, the residue of thy yajna.</xml>
<xml>22. O praiseworthy king, do not destroy canals, wells, tanks, corn</xml>
<xml>fields and forests. Protect us at every place. O Justice-loving king, we</xml>
<xml>take a solemn vow that cows and learned Brahmans whom thou declarest</xml>
<xml>to be unworthy of destruction, will not be killed by us. We will stick</xml>
<xml>to this resolve and so shouldest thou.</xml>
<xml>O king, in thy rule, may waters and medicines be friendly to us,</xml>
<xml>and unfriendly to him who dislikes us or whom we dislike.</xml>
<xml>23. O learned persons, see that these waters contribute to your</xml>
<xml>purity, comfort and usefulness. Air can be used and abused. May</xml>
<xml>pleasure-promoting yajna grant us happiness, may the sun give us health</xml>
<xml>and comfort.</xml>
<xml>24. O virgins, I set ye down in the assembly of learned bachelors.</xml>
<xml>21. Angas are th constituent parts of the vedas. They are six in number sciences of</xml>
<xml>pronunciation, fcWCT. rituals qpq grammar ozn^^I, etymology (H^'tf> astronomy vtflf^TCi prosody</xml>
<xml>!Jte*?. Their study helps in the correct pronunciation and interpretation of the vedas.</xml>
<xml>HWfl may also mean with thy splendour, prestige, and agony caused in the heart of foe.</xml>
<xml>24. The mistress addresses the girl pupils.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER VI 67</xml>
<xml>Ye are cognisant of the diverse qualities of sun and lighting, ye know</xml>
<xml>fully well the science of the control of breath, ye can make selection of</xml>
<xml>learned husbands.</xml>
<xml>Those of you, who after marriage live with husbands brilliant like</xml>
<xml>the sun, and with you whom, live brilliant husbands, should both advance</xml>
<xml>our domestic dealings.</xml>
<xml>25. O virgins, just as we live with our husbands and perform the</xml>
<xml>Havan, so do ye. Just as we impart instruction unto ye for mental</xml>
<xml>peace, for discriminating between virtue and vice, for spreading happi-,</xml>
<xml>ness, and acquiring brilliance like the sun, so do ye uplift the domestic</xml>
<xml>life for the diffusion of all kinds of happiness.</xml>
<xml>26. O noble king, like a father go near thy subjects, and let the</xml>
<xml>subjects like sons come near thee to seek protection. Just as fire is</xml>
<xml>kindled with wood-sticks, so hear my complaint and kindle justice. Let</xml>
<xml>versatile, learned and noble-minded queens, like mothers, hear the</xml>
<xml>complaints of women, and do justice unto them.</xml>
<xml>You magistrates who distinguish justice from injustice, listen to our</xml>
<xml>grievances.</xml>
<xml>O supreme king, endowed with knowledge, hear like sacrificing</xml>
<xml>learned persons, our requests made in an humble, laudatory tone.</xml>
<xml>27. O noble and virtuous subjects, select as your king for the</xml>
<xml>benefit of the learned persons and Brahmcharis who preserve their</xml>
<xml>semen, one, born out of you, who is high like the flood in water, fit for</xml>
<xml>service with food, endowed with strength, capable of subduing his foes,</xml>
<xml>and completely capable of adding to the happiness of his kingdom. Ye</xml>
<xml>too constitute a part of those learned persons.</xml>
<xml>28. O farmer, thou art fit to cultivate the land, I uplift thee for</xml>
<xml>the purification of space. Get waters from waters, and medicinal</xml>
<xml>plants from plants.</xml>
<xml>25. The mistress addresses her girl students. *NJTO[is the domestic life, the household</xml>
<xml>yajna, which the newly married wife is asked to advance and uplift through her devotion,</xml>
<xml>piety and sagacity.</xml>
<xml>28. A learned teacher addresses a cultivator. A farmer tills the land, and grows the</xml>
<xml>plants. Those plants ^ftTOP are used for performing Agnihotra. The oblations being rare-</xml>
<xml>fied rise up to heaven, fill the space Antriksha with vapours, purify the air, and descend</xml>
<xml>down to earth in the form of pure rainy water, which again grows the plants. This is a</xml>
<xml>natural process going on in nature ; aided by our yajna. Farmer is the main source of the</xml>
<xml>growth of plants, whereby Yajnas are performed, which fill the space with vapours, which</xml>
<xml>bring down pure rain, which again helps in the growth of plants.</xml>
<xml>68 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>29. O King, whomsoever thou protectest in the battle and appoint-</xml>
<xml>est for the supervision of food supply, deserves the award of a permanent</xml>
<xml>pension for his maintenance. This is a proper rule.</xml>
<xml>30. O my subjects, in this world created by God, the Giver of</xml>
<xml>happiness and the Source of all splendour, I receive ye with the strength</xml>
<xml>and coolness of the sun and moon, and the disease-killing, and bodily</xml>
<xml>humours equilibrium maintaining qualities of the herbs.</xml>
<xml>For me full of splendour, in a civilised manner, pay open-heartedly</xml>
<xml>the tax which is highly useful, is levied on all your products, which</xml>
<xml>conduces to efficient administration, which is utilized for the advance-</xml>
<xml>ment of industries and improving the cattle breed. O my subjects, ye</xml>
<xml>who take interest in the welfare of your king, deserve to be welcomed by</xml>
<xml>me. Please me by paying your taxes.</xml>
<xml>31. O subjects and legislators, satisfy my mind, satisfy my speech,</xml>
<xml>satisfy my breath, satisfy my eye, satisfy my ear, satisfy my soul, satisfy</xml>
<xml>my progeny, satisfy my cattle, satisfy my subordinate officers, so that</xml>
<xml>my officers may not feel sad.</xml>
<xml>32. O Lord, we appoint thee as a king, as thou possessest the</xml>
<xml>vigour of a Vasu Brahmchari, as thou hast got the strength of a Rudra</xml>
<xml>Brahmchari, as thou art full of splendour, full of knowledge like an Aditya</xml>
<xml>Brahmchari, as thou hast the power of killing the proud foes, as thou art</xml>
<xml>full of dignity, and art quick in attacking in the battle-field like a falcon,</xml>
<xml>as thou strergthenest our finances, and advancest the knowledge of</xml>
<xml>science.</xml>
<xml>29. He who succeeds in the battle, rules over many persons whom he subjugates.</xml>
<xml>Similarly one who is in charge of food-supply is the master of the destinies of thousands of</xml>
<xml>persons who depend upon him for the supply of necessaries of life.</xml>
<xml>30. A king addresses his subjects. He is described to prossess the strength and coolness</xml>
<xml>of the sun and moon, spoken of as arnr>, and the healing properties of the herbs spoken</xml>
<xml>of as hands. Just as medicinal plants remove our diseases, so does a king arrange for the</xml>
<xml>maintenance of the health of his subjects by spending liberally on sanitation, and medical</xml>
<xml>institutions .</xml>
<xml>There are three affections or humours gTcTC: in our body ; i. e>. 3T?T, fftf, W t t.*.</xml>
<xml>flatulence, bile and phlegm. The harmonious equilibrium of these maintains the body in a</xml>
<xml>healthy state. The king advises the subjects to pay gladly the taxes imposed, which will</xml>
<xml>be utilised for their advancement.</xml>
<xml>31. The king addresses the subjects.</xml>
<xml>32. A Vasu Brahmchari is one who observes the vow of celibacy for twentyfour</xml>
<xml>years, one who remains celebate for 36 years and acquires knowledge is Rudra Brahmchari,</xml>
<xml>and he who continues his studies observing celibacy for 48 years is called an Aditya</xml>
<xml>Brahmchari. The verse means the king selected should not be voluptuous and slave to</xml>
<xml>passions, but one who has duly observed the vow of celibacy and acquired knowledge.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER VI 69</xml>
<xml>33. O king thy rule extends over Heaven, Earth and mid-air wide</xml>
<xml>region. With that power show obligation to this worshipper who per-</xml>
<xml>forms the yajna, and has recourse to measures conducive to the propaga-</xml>
<xml>tion of national wealth.</xml>
<xml>34. O ladies, ye are the possessor of practical wisdom, removers</xml>
<xml>of all impediments, augmenters of wealth, helpers in the yajna, and</xml>
<xml>lovers of your virtuous husbands. Fulfil this sacrifice of domestic</xml>
<xml>life. Being invited taste with your husbands the sweet juice of the</xml>
<xml>plants like Soma.</xml>
<xml>35. O woman, full of physical and spiritual strength, be not afraid</xml>
<xml>of thy husband, shake not with terror, cultivate the strength of your</xml>
<xml>body and soul. O man, thou also shouldst behave similarly towards</xml>
<xml>thy wife, ye both, like the sun and earth should become strong and re-</xml>
<xml>solute ; whereby the shortcomings of ye both be removed, and ye become</xml>
<xml>happy like the moon.</xml>
<xml>36- O mother, love thy children, who run unto thee from east,</xml>
<xml>west, north, south and all other directions; and they too should love thee.</xml>
<xml>37. O mighty, glorious king, render thy subjects praiseworthy.</xml>
<xml>Thou art the conqueror of foes. None but thee is the giver of pleasure.</xml>
<xml>I say this unto thee.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER VII</xml>
<xml>1. O man, for realising God, the Lord of Speech purify thy mind.</xml>
<xml>Just as objects are purified by the rays of the sun, so purify thyself with</xml>
<xml>the outward and inward powers of a strong king. Be a learned man,</xml>
<xml>work pure-heartedly for the sages, who are adorable by thee.</xml>
<xml>2. O superb man of knowledge, sweeten our foods. O learned</xml>
<xml>preacher cf virtuous deeds, whatever well-known name free from harm,</xml>
<xml>thou hast, for the acquisition of power and carrying out thy instructions,</xml>
<xml>I attain to true deed, truthful speech and wide atmosphere of prosperity.</xml>
<xml>3. O brilliant soul, self-made art thou, for all subtle and gross</xml>
<xml>bodily organs, and for the learned that purify us like the beams of the sun.</xml>
<xml>May knowledge and vedic lore be acquired by thee.</xml>
<xml>O virtuous soul, I praise thee for thy nearness to God. Attain to</xml>
<xml>that Adorable, Truthful God. Thou hast promptly crushed and killed the</xml>
<xml>demon of ignorance. I extol thee for longevity and the acquisition of</xml>
<xml>happiness.</xml>
<xml>4. O aspirant after yoga, thou art the master of yamas and</xml>
<xml>niyamas. Control thou the internal vital breaths, mind and organs.</xml>
<xml>O rich lord, guard the supremacy emanating from yoga. Remove</xml>
<xml>through the power of yoga all ills arising from ignorance, whereby thou</xml>
<xml>mayest obtain supernatural power and the fulfilment of desires.</xml>
<xml>5. O Yogi, I place in thy heart knowledge spacious like the sun</xml>
<xml>and moon and mid air's wide region. Like a friend, acquiring learning</xml>
<xml>from the sages, and practising internal austerities, gladden others with</xml>
<xml>the preliminary and advanced usages of Yoga.</xml>
<xml>6. O supreme yogi, thy soul is self-made and eternal. Thou art</xml>
<xml>competent to cultivate all spiritual, mundane and physical forces. I</xml>
<xml>instruct thee to follow the lustrolis usages of yoga, for exhibiting the</xml>
<xml>practices of yoga like the sun, and for leading a pure and noble life by</xml>
<xml>controlling breath.</xml>
<xml>May thou an aspirant after yoga attain to a mind full of yogic</xml>
<xml>concentration, and know the best course for the observance of truth.</xml>
<xml>2. Through the grace and instructions of learned persons, one attains to the height of</xml>
<xml>prosperity, truthful speech and true deed, Free from harm means fit to afford protection.</xml>
<xml>5. God addresses a yogi. I means God.</xml>
<xml>6. In this verse also God addresses a yogi. Just as the sun spreads lustre on the</xml>
<xml>globe, so should a yogi teach the practices and systems of yoga to others.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER VII 71</xml>
<xml>7. O yogi, the cultivator of purity, and expert in the practices of</xml>
<xml>yoga, adorn thyself with the manifold definite virtues of mental peace</xml>
<xml>and contentment. O yogi, the possessor of diverse qualities, I send unto</xml>
<xml>thee the hunger-allaying food. O elevator of the soul through yoga,</xml>
<xml>thou possessest the yogic power to protect the pure yogis. I instruct</xml>
<xml>thee to practice such a yoga.</xml>
<xml>8. O student and teacher of yoga, these created pleasant objects</xml>
<xml>like water etc. long for ye both. Come with them. O aspirant after</xml>
<xml>yoga, thou hast been accepted with yogic yamas and niyamas, by the</xml>
<xml>teacher of yoga, for acquiring the knowledge of the animate aud inani-</xml>
<xml>mate objects through the power of yoga</xml>
<xml>O teacher of yoga, this yoga is like your pain-dispelling house. I</xml>
<xml>long for thee, well versed in the practice of yogic concentration, and the</xml>
<xml>student of yoga, full of qualities necessary for yoga.</xml>
<xml>9. O student and teacher of yoga, the augmenters of true know-</xml>
<xml>ledge, living in unison like the vital breaths the Pran and udan, here is</xml>
<xml>this your accomplished supremacy of yoga, Listen to my praise. O</xml>
<xml>worshipper, thou art endowed with noble traits, I welcome thee, who</xml>
<xml>controls the vital breaths, the Pran and Udan.</xml>
<xml>10. O learnd persons, the discriminators between right and wrong,</xml>
<xml>ye and we, should be delighted with acquirable riches, just as cows are</xml>
<xml>with grass. O noble and friendly souls, ye both give us daily the speech</xml>
<xml>that rightly teaches us the knowledge of yoga. O worshipper, this</xml>
<xml>knowledge of yours is thy shelter like a house. We welcome thee along</xml>
<xml>with the observers of Truth.</xml>
<xml>11. O student and teacher of yoga, resplendent like the sun and the</xml>
<xml>moon, desire to develop yoga by your sweet and dawn-like pleasant</xml>
<xml>speeeh. O student of yoga, thou hast been welcomed for thy noble</xml>
<xml>traits. This yoga of yours is a house unto thee for comfort.</xml>
<xml>We approach thee, well versed in yogic laws of the control of breath,</xml>
<xml>and thy teacher, expert in the sweet practices and methods of yoga.</xml>
<xml>7. In this verse God addresses a yogi. A yogi ought to be very careful fn his diet,</xml>
<xml>He should take little but nourishing diet to satisfy his hunger.</xml>
<xml>9. Mitra and Varuna are the disciple and teacher. The dhciple is spoken of as fofcf,</xml>
<xml>and the teacher as g^uras he dispels the deficiencies and drawbacks of the disciple ; or the</xml>
<xml>teacher may be considered as fJf5T being friendly and affectionate to his pupils, and the disciple</xml>
<xml>as WT who cultivates virtues and shuns vices.</xml>
<xml>10. fo3ra*on are the student and the teacher of yoga ; 3Kngn*l also means the teacber</xml>
<xml>and the disciple who aspire after Truth.</xml>
<xml>72 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>12, O yogi, thou art the master of all the branches of yoga. This</xml>
<xml>yogic propensity of thine conduces to thy happiness. Through yoga,</xml>
<xml>freed from the shackles of ignorance, thou art full of peace. Thou</xml>
<xml>elevatest thy soul through various yogic practices.</xml>
<xml>Like all the ancient sages and yogis and modern yogis, thou per-</xml>
<xml>fectest the yoga, which is highly commendable, deeply seated in the soul,</xml>
<xml>pleasure-giving, inimical to nescience, quick at success, elevating,</xml>
<xml>victory-giving, and quiverer of bodily organs.</xml>
<xml>Let the guardians of yogic force, and yogis resplendent with the</xml>
<xml>power of yoga, instruct thee in yoga. Mayest thou be invincible through</xml>
<xml>that yoga. Protect thou the manly power, which in turn will protect</xml>
<xml>thee,</xml>
<xml>13. .O yogi, endowed with yogic force, cultivate noble traits, like</xml>
<xml>an exalted hjro. Go to all places. Be friendly towards the charitably</xml>
<xml>disposed person, who perfects his riches through charity.</xml>
<xml>Thou art the mainstay of yoga, being full of mental peace, free from</xml>
<xml>desire for passions, full of strength like the sun and earth, and purifier of</xml>
<xml>all like the sun.</xml>
<xml>14 O well mannered disciple desiring to learn yoga, we your</xml>
<xml>teachers, are the givers for you of uninterrupted, chivalrous strength</xml>
<xml>of the knowledge of yoga.</xml>
<xml>May our preliminary method of teaching, acceptable to all, be</xml>
<xml>accomodating to thee. May he, who is spiritually advanced and highly</xml>
<xml>learned amongst us, be first of all friendly to thee.</xml>
<xml>15. O pupils, just as a learned teacher, the protector of knowledge</xml>
<xml>tries for advancement, so should ye, to be great, resort to truth and</xml>
<xml>virtuous deeds.</xml>
<xml>12. This verse clearly describes qualities and characteristics of a yogi. There is no</xml>
<xml>ambiguity about its meaning. Mr. Griffith remarks "The text taken with a variation from</xml>
<xml>R.V, 5.44.1 is hopelessly obscure." I find no obscurity in it. Mr. Griffith interprets</xml>
<xml>Shanda as a demon for whom the cup is drawn, and then offered to a deity, whereas</xml>
<xml>Mabarshi Dayananda interprets the word as 'full of peace.* A yogi is spoken of as invincible,</xml>
<xml>but Mr. Griffith remarks ; 'The right hip of the high altar, on which the Adhvaryu deposits</xml>
<xml>his cup is addressed and secured from the attacks of demons. 1 What sense is there in</xml>
<xml>calling the hip of the altar as invincible. The interpretation of vedic mantras by Mr.</xml>
<xml>Griffith is a meaningless jargon, the perusal of which shakens one's faith in the revelation</xml>
<xml>of the vedas God does not utter nonsense in the vedas, which are full of sense, wisdom,</xml>
<xml>knowledge and truth. A biased interpreter cannot arrive at the correct significance of</xml>
<xml>vedic hymns. To him the plainest verse seems to be hopelessly obscure, which is highly</xml>
<xml>regrettable.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER VII 73</xml>
<xml>Just as affable, sweet, high-minded, happy ladies, well versed in</xml>
<xml>yoga, and a learned yogi, remain contented, so should yee, like them.</xml>
<xml>16* O' skilful ruler, thou art equipped with army, the essential</xml>
<xml>mainstay of kingship. I fix in its orbit, in the midst of spacious regions,</xml>
<xml>this beautiful moon that covers the luminous stars, and is linked with</xml>
<xml>the sun and the waters that it attracts. Just as learned persons wisely</xml>
<xml>and respectfully accept a young pupil, so do I accept thee for curbing the</xml>
<xml>sinful and establishing the code of morality.</xml>
<xml>17. O' skilful ruler, this art of government is thy mainstay. Just</xml>
<xml>as thou, master of wealth, and protector of thy subjects, and the wise</xml>
<xml>people of thine, both perform Havan with alertness, and determined</xml>
<xml>mind, and acting wisely contribute to the welfare of the state, so should</xml>
<xml>each subordinate of thine, on the signal of thy finger, remove enemies</xml>
<xml>from all sides. Let the wicked and agonising foe be cast aside. Protect</xml>
<xml>thy subjects.</xml>
<xml>Let the learned, who quell the foes, add to thy happineS5. O</xml>
<xml>people protect the ruler that grants ye independence and fearlessness.</xml>
<xml>18. O' ruler, having loyal subjects, whose maker art thou, fill with</xml>
<xml>profuse wealth him who does noble deeds. Be thou patient like the</xml>
<xml>Sun and Earth. Thou art the support of the just. With the moral</xml>
<xml>power of thy justice, may the unjust be suppressed.</xml>
<xml>19. In their majesty, eleven mighty substances reside in heaven,</xml>
<xml>on the earth and in respiration. Just as they perform their functions</xml>
<xml>faithfully, so should you the members of the House of the People, carry</xml>
<xml>on the administration of the State with zeal and devotion.</xml>
<xml>20. O' ruler, thou art an embodiment of humility and vedic lore,</xml>
<xml>thou art the doer of laudable deeds, and worthy of respect. Protect</xml>
<xml>the administration of justice. May the virtuous, and the learned</xml>
<xml>protect thee. May thou fully protect the learned, and all works that</xml>
<xml>contribute to prosperity.</xml>
<xml>21. O' learned people, just as the amiable ruler purifies himself</xml>
<xml>19. (a) The eleven substances in heaven are, Pran, Apan, Udan, Vyan, Saman, Nag,</xml>
<xml>Kurma, Krikla, Dev Dutt, Dhananjya and soul. The first ten are the names of different</xml>
<xml>breaths.</xml>
<xml>(b) The eleven substances on the earth are Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Space, Sun,</xml>
<xml>Moon, Stars, Ego (31JW) and Mahat Tatva (H^Tccf), Intellect, the second of the 25 principles</xml>
<xml>of the Sankhyas and matter.</xml>
<xml>(c) The eleven substances in respiration are, Ear, Skin, Eye, Tongue, Nose, Speech,</xml>
<xml>Hands, Feet, Anus, penis and mind.</xml>
<xml>74 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>for knowing God and the veda, tries to acquire military knowledge,</xml>
<xml>makes strenuous efforts for the advancement of scholars and friends of</xml>
<xml>learning, is eager to produce foodstuffs which add to our vitality, exerts</xml>
<xml>for the collection of medicines and canalizing waters, desires for the</xml>
<xml>light of the sun and improvement of all material objects, avoids vice to</xml>
<xml>acquire virtue, so should ye and other citizens do. O ruler, successful</xml>
<xml>administration is thy aim. We honour thee for the betterment of the</xml>
<xml>learned, and noble qualities of thine.</xml>
<xml>22. O General, I appoint thee, well versed in knowledge, the doer</xml>
<xml>of valorous deeds, advanced in age, full of dignity, expert in the know-</xml>
<xml>ledge of arms, as Commander-in-chief of the forces. I direct thee to</xml>
<xml>lead a grand life. I advise thee to be God-fearing. The command of</xml>
<xml>the army is thy foremost duty. I enjoin thee to preserve the interests</xml>
<xml>of the state, to perform praiseworthy vedic acts, cultivate and preserve</xml>
<xml>noble qualities.</xml>
<xml>23. We elect thee as head of the state, for the betterment of</xml>
<xml>our country's administration, for the protection of the learned, the</xml>
<xml>friendly and noble souls.</xml>
<xml>We elect thee for the promotion of political conferences, for the</xml>
<xml>encouragement of the learned and lofty souls.</xml>
<xml>We elect thee, for the promotion of engineering works, for</xml>
<xml>establishing electrical power-houses, and for the advancement of</xml>
<xml>knowledge.</xml>
<xml>We elect thee for making full use of electricity and water, for</xml>
<xml>promoting industrial works, and spreading their knowledge. We elect</xml>
<xml>thee, the master of the science of yoga, for the spread of literacy, and</xml>
<xml>encouragement of the sages who preach religious truths.</xml>
<xml>We elect thee, the gratifier of those who know God, for the</xml>
<xml>promotion of scientific knowledge, lor the spread of theism and vedic</xml>
<xml>lore.</xml>
<xml>22. In this mantra the head of the state is advised to appoint a man as Commander-in-</xml>
<xml>chief who is the embodiment of knowledge, spirituality nnd valour. I refers to the head of</xml>
<xml>the state.</xml>
<xml>23. In this mantra the subjects have been asked to elect their own ruler, who should</xml>
<xml>be imbued with knowledge and noble qualities, and devoted to improve the country industri-</xml>
<xml>ally and mechanically. This mantra is a clear proof that the vedas preach democracy, and</xml>
<xml>are against autocracy.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER VII 75</xml>
<xml>24. Just as masters of the science of archery, who arc at the top</xml>
<xml>of the learned, like the sun that stands highest in the atmosphere, know</xml>
<xml>the qualities of ores inside the earth, are well known for their good</xml>
<xml>behaviour in the path of righteousness, afford delight to all, and are</xml>
<xml>respected by all like a guest, protect mechanical arts through their self-</xml>
<xml>less life, establish the qualities of lustrous fire as a king establishes the</xml>
<xml>greatness of his country in the world, so should all do.</xml>
<xml>25. O' God, Thou art realised through spiritual knowledge, Thou</xml>
<xml>art unchangeable, the earth rests in thee, Thou art firmest amongst the</xml>
<xml>firm substances like sound and space, Thou art most immortal amongst</xml>
<xml>the immortal, Thou art the fountain of the light of truth. I constantly,</xml>
<xml>with a determined mind and voice accept Thee, as leader of humanity</xml>
<xml>on the path of righteousness, and Creator of the universe. So now</xml>
<xml>may Thou, the dispeller of all miseries, make our people all of one heart</xml>
<xml>and mind, and free from foes.</xml>
<xml>26. O' performer of yajna, thy substances collected for the yajna,</xml>
<xml>go forth in air everywhere. The substances offered in the yajna, being</xml>
<xml>purified are let loose from the clouds in the sky, and come down to the</xml>
<xml>earth. I ask thee to perform that yajna, which is conducted by</xml>
<xml>Adhvaryu, Hota, Udgata and Brahma, and carry out thy resolution with</xml>
<xml>a stout heart and truthful speech.</xml>
<xml>Thou art the exalted light for the learned.</xml>
<xml>27. O' teacher, grow thou pure for my outward breath, and impart</xml>
<xml>knowledge to me. O 1 giver of spirituality, grow thou pure for my</xml>
<xml>spreading breath, and supply food to me. O imparter of knowledge grow</xml>
<xml>thou pure for my upward breath and grant me prowess. O' preacher of</xml>
<xml>truth, be attentive to my speech and eminence. O educator teach me</xml>
<xml>as how to improve my soul-force and intellect, and how to acquire sound</xml>
<xml>knowledge. O teacher of grammar, teach for my ear that catches sound,</xml>
<xml>the relation of the words with their meanings and their use. O' learned</xml>
<xml>guest and teacher teach me true principles.</xml>
<xml>28. O teacher of yoga and knowledge of God, reveal thy soul-force</xml>
<xml>24. Swami Dayananda gives the purport of this mantra as follows :</xml>
<xml>Just as those who have the knowledge of the Dhanur Veda gain victory over their</xml>
<xml>enemies by the use of fire in arms and planes, so should all others do.</xml>
<xml>26. In this mantra God inculcates the yajman to perform the yajnas. Adhvaryu, Hota,</xml>
<xml>Udgata, and Brahma are the custodians and conductors of the yajna with separate duties</xml>
<xml>allotted to them,</xml>
<xml>76 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>for my soul. O giver of knowledge, teach me yoga> for the amelioration</xml>
<xml>of my soul. O' giver of strength, for my long life, give me the disease-</xml>
<xml>killing medicine. O' learner and teacher of yoga, ye both strive for</xml>
<xml>imparting noble qualities to my descendants.</xml>
<xml>29. O' king, who art thou ? Who amongst us all art thou.</xml>
<xml>Whose son art thou ? What is thy name ? We want to have thy know-</xml>
<xml>ledge, and satisfy thee with wealth.</xml>
<xml>I like the majesty of the Earth, the Space, and the Sun, desirous of</xml>
<xml>my betterment, wish to have good subjects like you; be possessed of</xml>
<xml>warlike soldiers like you, be vigorous by the use of life-giving substances.</xml>
<xml>30. O King, thou art the master of the art of administration, we</xml>
<xml>accept thee as our Lord, in all the twelve months of Chaitra, Vaisakha,</xml>
<xml>Jyaishtha, Ashadha, Sravana, Bhadra, Asvin, Kartika, Margashirsha,</xml>
<xml>Pausha, Magha, Phalguna months, and for the protection of us all.</xml>
<xml>31. O Speaker and members of the Assembly, shining like the sun</xml>
<xml>and fire, assemble together, and add to our immense pleasure through</xml>
<xml>didactic discussions. Protect our welfare with your trained intellect.</xml>
<xml>You have been initiated in the rules and duties of government. We</xml>
<xml>realise your relation towards us. The art of administration is your she-</xml>
<xml>lter. We explain this to you.</xml>
<xml>32. The members of the Parliament, well versed in vedic lore,</xml>
<xml>throw light on learning and science ; and overcast the sky uninterruptedly</xml>
<xml>with planes. The President of the Republic is ever young, stout in body,</xml>
<xml>friendly and imposing. Those brilliant and illustrious members take</xml>
<xml>you as loyal subjects. Justice is your shelter. We teach you the above</xml>
<xml>mentioned arts.</xml>
<xml>29. This mantra is a dialogue between the king and his subjects. In the first part of the</xml>
<xml>text the subjects question the ruler to know hjs identity. In the second half, the ruler replies,</xml>
<xml>identifying himself completely with the men placed in his charge.</xml>
<xml>30. The subjects accept the king as their ruler throughout the year, and the king accepts</xml>
<xml>the subjects as his advisers for the whole year. This is the ideal of democracy. The ruler is</xml>
<xml>elected vide vedic teaching. There is no vestige of autocracy, despotism or totalitarianism.</xml>
<xml>The king is made and unmade. Chaitra is Mid March to Mid April. Vaisakh is April-May,</xml>
<xml>Jyaishtha is May-June, Asbadh June-July, Sravana, July-August. Bhadra, August-September,</xml>
<xml>Aswin, September-October, Kartika, October-November, Margashirsha. November-December,</xml>
<xml>Pausha, December-January. Magha, January-February. Phalguna, February-March.</xml>
<xml>31. We means the Speaker and members of the Parliament, and you the subjects.</xml>
<xml>The text is a dialogue. In the first half, the people request the Speaker and members at</xml>
<xml>the House of the People, and in the latter half of the text they reply.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER VII 77</xml>
<xml>33. O' ye all learned people, the nourishers and preservers of</xml>
<xml>humanity with noble qualities ; the imparters of knowledge, accept this</xml>
<xml>son of a charitably disposed person as your pupil.</xml>
<xml>O pupil, I accept thee as a seeker after knowledge. I instruct thee</xml>
<xml>to serve all the learned persons, whereby thou mayest enlarge thy store</xml>
<xml>of knowledge. I move the learned to impart good instructions to thee.</xml>
<xml>34. O ye all learned people, come near us, hear our invocations.</xml>
<xml>Seat yourselves upon this seat. O son, thou hast been accepted as a</xml>
<xml>pupil by the learned, we hand thee over to them for acquiring know-</xml>
<xml>ledge. Let the attainment of learning be thy aim. We desire thee to</xml>
<xml>receive knowledge from them,</xml>
<xml>35. O 1 ruler, the remover of our difficulties, worthy of praise, and</xml>
<xml>guardian of the subjects, advance the cause of education in the universe,</xml>
<xml>as thou hast drunk deep the essence of knowledge with thy efforts.</xml>
<xml>O valiant king, under thy just rule, the wise and the learned,</xml>
<xml>carry out thy sound policy.</xml>
<xml>O king, thou hast been recognised for the protection of the subjects.</xml>
<xml>We like thee for thy good relations with the subjects and thy august</xml>
<xml>personality. The spread of education is thy foremost duty. We recog-</xml>
<xml>nise thee as our ruler for thy good relations with the subjects and thy</xml>
<xml>august personality.</xml>
<xml>36. We learned persons accept as our ruler, thee, the introducer</xml>
<xml>of new plans for our advancement, the master of loyal subjects, the</xml>
<xml>embodiment of virtue, the most advanced in noble qualities and acts,</xml>
<xml>the queller of the irreligious, the pure, the specimen of endurance, the</xml>
<xml>master of prowess, and the helper and educator af all.</xml>
<xml>As thou art the master of all laws big or small ; we accept thee, for</xml>
<xml>having good subjects, and possessing supremacy. The administration of</xml>
<xml>justice is thy duty. As thou art the master of all laws big or small, we</xml>
<xml>accept thee for having good subjects and possessing supremacy. We</xml>
<xml>accept thee as our head for enhancing the might of the people.</xml>

<xml>34. We refers to the parents.</xml>
<xml>35. Mahidhar and Griffith have wrongly interpreted STTOfa as the grandson of Manu</xml>
<xml>and the son of Sharyati, as there is no mention to this effect in the Shatapath Brahman, and</xml>
<xml>the Vedas are free from historical references. Rishi Dayananda translates it as through the</xml>
<xml>exertion of hands and feet.</xml>

<xml>faithfully and energetically.</xml>

<xml>significance of all objects. Acquire knowledge, and suppress the</xml>
<xml>opponents of truth and justice. Be victorious in the battle-field. Make</xml>
<xml>all free from fear everywhere.</xml>

<xml>five classes of subjects under thy sway, and armies, strong in body and soul,</xml>
<xml>take with thy meals, invigorating herbs, for pleasure and conquest. Fill</xml>
<xml>thy belly with the sweet flow of well-cooked meals. Thou art the</xml>
<xml>sovereign of all great deeds and requiring deep thought. Thou hast been</xml>
<xml>initiated in the rules of administration ; we harness thee for battle involv-</xml>
<xml>ing the use of arms and weapons. This battle is the source of thy</xml>

<xml>performed for Thine attainment conduces to our welfare. Hence we</xml>
<xml>worship Thee for emancipation. Thou art Great. Like the raining cloud,</xml>
<xml>Thou art famous with the praises of the worshipper. Knowing Thee, the</xml>
<xml>yogi attains to spiritual advncement.</xml>
<xml>41. Just as rays exhibit the shining all-penetrating sun to the whole</xml>

<xml>learned persons. He is the Displayer of air, water and fire. He is the</xml>

<xml>Protector of the Sun, Earth and Atmosphere. He is Resplendent, and soul</xml>
<xml>of all that moves and all that moves not. Always worship Him alone.</xml>
<xml>43. O f God, for the attainment of yoga, lead us on, through the</xml>
<xml>path of yoga, to all the secrets of yoga. Whereby, we may offer Thee</xml>
<xml>ample adoration through vedic texts. Thou, the Giver and Knower of</xml>
<xml>Yoga, remove from us the sin resulting from the crookedness of our heart.</xml>
<xml>44. This first warrior, the master of medical science, keeps us</xml>
<xml>free from disease on the battle field. This second warrior, the destroyer</xml>
<xml>of foes, marches forth on the battle field. This third warrior, the preacher,</xml>
<xml>should encourage the fast moving brave soldiers. This fourth warrior,</xml>
<xml>full of delight, should subdue the irreligious foes.</xml>

<xml>sprung from a laudable father and grandfather, is a sage himself, knows</xml>
<xml>the knowledge imparted by the sages, is the fit recipient of rich guerdon,</xml>

<xml>on us, and learn good traits from them.</xml>

<xml>rebukes the foes. The fourth defeats the foes. Victory is won by the concerted action of all</xml>

<xml>the donors by asking them to make the proper use of their wealth which will make them pure</xml>

<xml>mankind I fain would be the brightest.</xml>
<xml>41. The learned as seers, verily dilate upon God, the Creator of</xml>
<xml>the vedas, the Embodiment of purity and effulgence ; for the good of</xml>
<xml>humanity. May we realise that God. We accept thee for the control</xml>
<xml>of highly active breath, through yoga and laws of austerity.</xml>
<xml>Thy universal pervasion through the union of cause and effect is</xml>
<xml>an unsurpassed authority. We accept Thee as the Giver of resplendent</xml>
<xml>knowledge.</xml>
<xml>42. O' exalted wife , possessing vast knowledge, eatable and drink-</xml>
<xml>able articles, smell thou the jar. Mayest thou obtain thousands of juices</xml>
<xml>of medicinal herbs, whereby thou mayest be free from sorrow. Fill us</xml>
<xml>again with prosperity. Let riches come again to me.</xml>
<xml>43. Praiseworthy, delightful, worshipful, lovable, pleasuregiving,</xml>
<xml>well known for good behaviour, Inviolable, full of knowledge, Adorable,</xml>
<xml>Knower of the vedas, worthy of respect. These are thy names O 1 wife.</xml>
<xml>Teach me the good lesson of acquiring noble qualities.</xml>
<xml>44. O 1 general, beat our foes away, humble the men who challenge</xml>
<xml>us. As the sun removes darkness, so send down to a degraded position,</xml>
<xml>him who seeks to do us injury.</xml>
<xml>42. The jars in which the wife keeps eatables should be smelt and examined by her</xml>
<xml>if they are fit for consumption and have not become rotten and decayed.</xml>
<xml>43, In this verse eleven names of a wife have been enumerated, e. g. t Ida, Ratna,</xml>
<xml>Havya, Kamya, Chandra, Jyoti, Aditi, Saraswati, Mahi, Vishruti and Aghanya. How beauti-</xml>
<xml>ful and splendid this verse is, which gives eleven qualities a woman should possess.</xml>
<xml>88 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>We accept thee equipped with forces for the grant of hafrpinesfc</xml>
<xml>and dispelling our foes. This action of thine is the secret of thy rule.</xml>
<xml>We urge thee to grant us happiness and remove our enemies.</xml>
<xml>45. Let us invoke to-day, to aid our struggle for existence, the</xml>
<xml>Lord of the Vedas, the Doer of all noble deeds, and the Knower of what</xml>
<xml>passes in our minds. May He hear kindly all our invocations, Who</xml>
<xml>gives us all bliss, Whose works are righteous.</xml>
<xml>This act of God is due to His love. We pray unto Thee for pros-</xml>
<xml>perity and success in all actions. We adore Thee for success in all actions</xml>
<xml>and for prosperity.</xml>
<xml>46. O' doer of all good deeds, with ever-growing knowledge, thou</xml>
<xml>selectest as a ruler one who is free from vice and irreligion, the giver of</xml>
<xml>prosperity and protection. The educated subjects bow unto him. Exert</xml>
<xml>that he becomes the suppressor of the wicked and the master of all</xml>
<xml>resources. This act of thine is due to your love. We invoke thy aid</xml>
<xml>for prosperity and success in all actions. We pray to thee for success in</xml>
<xml>all actions, and for prosperity.</xml>
<xml>47. O 1 noble king, thy praiseworthy speech dispels our ignorance.</xml>
<xml>I accept thee, the knower of Gayatri metre verses, for knowing the</xml>
<xml>attributes of fire and electricity. I accept thee, the preacher of the</xml>
<xml>significance of vedic verses in Trishtup metre.</xml>
<xml>I accept thee, the expounder of the Jagati verses, for acquiring all</xml>
<xml>good qualities, actions and attributes. Anushtap verses are thy preceptor.</xml>
<xml>We have accepted thee for all these qualities.</xml>
<xml>48. O' irreligious husband, I warn thee against cohabitation with</xml>
<xml>the pure and noble wives of others. O' evil-minded husband, I desist</xml>
<xml>thee from approaching the tender-hearted wives of others. O' ill-inten-</xml>
<xml>tioned husband I keep thee away from going near the philanthropic wives</xml>
<xml>of others, O' unsteady husband, I censure thee again and again for teasing</xml>
<xml>the delightful wives of others. O v stone-hearted husband, I separate thee</xml>
<xml>from the company of sweet -tongued wives of others. O' ignorant husband,</xml>
<xml>full of virility, I prohibit thee from sexual intercourse in day's light and</xml>
<xml>sun's beams.</xml>
<xml>46. Vedas preach the doctrine of democracy. A ruler is selected by election and not</xml>
<xml>succession.</xml>
<xml>47. Gayatri, Trishtup, Jagati and Anushtup are metres in which the vedic verses are</xml>
<xml>revealed.</xml>
<xml>48 . This is a beautiful verse in which the wife is described as the saviour of her husband</xml>
<xml>from moral degradation.</xml>

<xml>kill the man with warlike instruments, who fain would war with us.</xml>
<xml>If the forces of the enemy approach our sturdy forces and try to</xml>
<xml>increase their strength, kill them without fail, and drive them away, for</xml>
<xml>your own happiness.</xml>
<xml>O 1 Hero, the Tenderer of our foes, rend our foes in all possible ways,</xml>

<xml>and take pure food; ye will ever remain happy.</xml>
<xml>55. O 1 learned persons understand, for success in your transactions</xml>
<xml>the use of electricity, wind, and cloud. Know Ye the Dhananjay Vayu,</xml>

<xml>God, present in our souls, ever near us for our protection, ever shining</xml>
<xml>before us, and well-versed in His function.</xml>

<xml>90 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>56.O 1 married people in this world, just as ye honour and seat on A</xml>

<xml>beautiful objects, the aged sun, the invisible matter brought into creation,</xml>
<xml>the invigorating vital airs, pure semen and the noble, active suppressor of</xml>
<xml>foes. Thus ye become the utilisers of all objects, and eaters of milk</xml>
<xml>products.</xml>
<xml>58. Those who through Homa spread wide upto clouds the fragrant</xml>
<xml>spices, have devoted their lives to noble deeds, are accepted as mighty</xml>
<xml>souls, are the well known seers of men, and are known as powerful like a</xml>
<xml>storm, are eaters of eatables, and should all be recognised as wise, learned</xml>
<xml>preachers of humanity.</xml>
<xml>59. Those, who for their bath manage to get pure water, construct</xml>
<xml>canals, soar high in space, by their strength maintain the worlds, who in</xml>
<xml>their prowess are most brave and powerful, whose power is not known to</xml>
<xml>ordinary mortals, who are comprehensive in character and noble in nature,</xml>
<xml>and whose praise is sung by the ancient sages, are received by the learned.</xml>
<xml>They always remain happy.</xml>
<xml>60. The yajna grants us foodstuffs and spreads the light of</xml>
<xml>knowledge, the learned perform it, may knowledge thence come to me.</xml>
<xml>The yajna goes to men and clouds, the wise perform it; may riches come</xml>
<xml>thence to me. The yajna goes to seasons and the Earth, the sages per-</xml>
<xml>form it, may come thence each season's comfort to me.</xml>
<xml>Whatever sphere the yajna (sacrifice) reaches, which the religious</xml>
<xml>minded people perform, may happiness come thence to me.</xml>
<xml>61. Thirtyfour threads diffuse this yajna of the world. They</xml>
<xml>sustain it with supply of food. I skilfully unify their different functions</xml>
<xml>and duties. May this yajna be controlled by the learned.</xml>
<xml>59, *rat : (yayo) refers to the priest and the worshipper according to Maharshi</xml>
<xml>Dayananda, and to God and Zjff yajna by some other commentators. In this verse is sung the</xml>
<xml>praise of the priest (Hota) and worshipper (yajnaan) who through their yajna purify and</xml>

<xml>good conduct enjoy full age.</xml>
<xml>63. O' married man, desirous of prosperity, with thy noble be-</xml>

<xml>battle, see the enemies from a distance and go towards different direc-</xml>
<xml>tions to check their onward march.</xml>
<xml>14. Just as this fast horse bound by the neck, and at the flanks</xml>
<xml>and in the mouth, ever accelerating its speed, passes by the mile-stones,</xml>
<xml>with full force and goes to the army ; so does the cammander of the army,</xml>
<xml>with due orders, make it march on speedily.</xml>

<xml>education from the learned, who has observed the vow of celibacy for</xml>
<xml>forty eight years, who holds sway over administrative problems, is</xml>
<xml>supreme among the learned, is master of all the four vedas, and protector</xml>
<xml>of the sages.</xml>
<xml>27. O' King, with a sound policy, for the spread of knowledge,</xml>
<xml>urge, the lover of impartial justice," the teacher of all sciences, the master</xml>

<xml>thou art the giver of wealth.</xml>
<xml>29. As the Lord of Justice gives us good instruction, as the</xml>
<xml>nourisher gives us strength of body and soul, just as a learned man gives</xml>
<xml>us knowledge, so let the mother, a sweet-tongued and nice instructor</xml>
<xml>impart knowledge unto us.</xml>
<xml>30. O' good-natured educated person, I, in this world created by</xml>
<xml>the Effulgent God, appoint thee as King with the knowledge of the Vedas,</xml>
<xml>with arms strong like the sun and moon, with hands swift like the wind.</xml>
<xml>I anoint thee with supreme kingship in this state well organised by the</xml>

<xml>elevate them. Just as the just King, with trisyllabic metre elevates</xml>
<xml>the three worlds, so may I elevate them. Just as a King desirous for</xml>

<xml>26. In this verse, God preaches that there should be separate female magistrates to do</xml>
<xml>justice to the famales, and male-magistrates for the males, as in the presence of males, females,</xml>
<xml>through shyness and fear, canot speak out their mind and make a frank, oral or written state-</xml>
<xml>meat. Males should teach the boys and females the girls. The vedas are against co-education.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XT 107</xml>
<xml>28. O King, thou art the conqueror of foes, May these five regions</xml>
<xml>be prosperous for thee. O King, the master of spiritual knowledge, thou</xml>
<xml>art the maker of the state. Thou art the creator of prosperity through</xml>
<xml>righteous dealings. Thou art affable in nature through real power. Thou</xml>
<xml>art the giver of comforts, through the splendour of thy subjects. Thou</xml>

<xml>endeavourest again and again. Thou art the grantor of prosperity.</xml>
<xml>Therewith grant me strength to do my duty.</xml>
<xml>29. O King, just as spacious fire, dutiful and serviceable, residing</xml>
<xml>in the midst of other allied objects, duly receives oblations of ghee, and</xml>
<xml>gives happiness by diffusing them through the beams of the sun, soshouldst</xml>
<xml>thou, the guardian of justice, large-hearted, and servant of the State,</xml>
<xml>acquire sovereignty. So should the true workers exert.</xml>
<xml>30. I go forward urged onward by the impelling God, the truthful</xml>
<xml>speech full of Vedic knowledge, the justice based on real facts, the Earth</xml>
<xml>that rears different cattle, our supremacy, the master of vedic knowledge,</xml>
<xml>the unperturbed tranquillity, the fiery strength to suppress the enemies,</xml>
<xml>the pleasure giving brilliance of the moon, and by the tenth, i.e., acting</xml>

<xml>the sun and moon, try hard to obtain the knowledge of the Vedas, exert</xml>
<xml>your utmost, for supremacy that affords protection. By leading a re-</xml>

<xml>knowledge, be friend unto God, by practising yoga.</xml>
<xml>32. O learned King, full of supremacy, thou the observer of the vow</xml>
<xml>of celibacy, art accepted by us, for the betterment of the learned teachers,</xml>
<xml>for acquisition of the knowledge of the Vedas, for power and protection.</xml>
<xml>Just as agriculturists whose fields are full of barley, reap the ripe corn,</xml>
<xml>and remove the chaff in order, so bring food in a decent way to the</xml>
<xml>aged, who deserve respect and homage. .</xml>
<xml>33. O Speaker of the Assembly and Commander of the Army, ye,</xml>
<xml>the united protectors of the State, and doers of altruistic deeds, protect</xml>

<xml>protect their child.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XI</xml>
<xml>1. An aspirant after superhuman power for the acquisition of</xml>
<xml>spiritual knowledge, should first of all harness his mind and intellect</xml>
<xml>with yoga. Having fully realised the high light of Omniscient God, he</xml>
<xml>should show it to others on this earth.</xml>
<xml>2. We, the yogis, with full concentration of mind, according to</xml>
<xml>our resources, in this world created by the supreme Lord, should strive</xml>
<xml>to acquire His Light, for our happiness.</xml>
<xml>3. The master of the knowledge of yoga, having concentrated his</xml>
<xml>mind on God, should with his intellect cultivate noble qualities, which</xml>
<xml>spread the light of knowledge, and add to happiness* God guides them</xml>
<xml>who advance scientific knowledge.</xml>
<xml>4. The learned, who give and take knowledge, unite their mind</xml>
<xml>and intellect riveted upon God, Who is Mighty and the fountain of</xml>
<xml>knowledge. He alone, the Knower of all acts, worlds and sciences,</xml>
<xml>declares law. Mighty is the praise of God, Who is the creator of the</xml>
<xml>universe and Giver of knowledge.</xml>
<xml>5. O seekers after yoga, I, wedded to truth, unite my soul with</xml>
<xml>God, realised by past sages through prayer and meditation.</xml>
<xml>May that God be realised by ye both through diverse efforts, just</xml>
<xml>as a learned person finds the true path and sticks to it. All noble souls</xml>
<xml>should listen to yoga vidya, so that they may acquire salvation and reach</xml>
<xml>regions full of joys.</xml>
<xml>6. O yogis, the learned souls, should follow through contemplation,</xml>
<xml>God, the Embodiment of happiness, and the Giver of peace. The Omni-</xml>
<xml>present, Effulgent Lord, the creator of the universe, brings into existence</xml>
<xml>the material worlds through His glory and power. He alone deserves</xml>
<xml>worship.</xml>
<xml>7. O God, the Bestower of knowledge, and Father of all accom-</xml>
<xml>plishments, create for our advancement the pleasant usages, and their</xml>
<xml>protectors. O Sustainer of the Earth, Master of fine qualities, acts and</xml>
<xml>nature, and Purifier through knowledge, purify our thought and will.</xml>

<xml>9. O Vedic speech, in this world created by the Omniscient Lord,</xml>
<xml>I with the forces of sun and moon and the pran and apan forces of the</xml>
<xml>air, with the teachings of verses in Gayatri metre, accept thee dear</xml>
<xml>as breath.</xml>
<xml>O vedic speech, bestow on me, from this alter knowledge, the</xml>
<xml>benefactor of humanity. Grant me the strength of knowledge dear as</xml>
<xml>breath, through verses in Trishtup metre.</xml>
<xml>10. O vedic speech, thou art the bestower of knowledge, benefi-</xml>
<xml>cial for the people like woman. Through thee, in this place of knowledge,</xml>
<xml>may we be able to explore learning. With a life of celibacy for 48 years,</xml>
<xml>may we improve our learning.</xml>
<xml>11. The skilled artisan, following the instructions given in the</xml>
<xml>Anushtap verses, firmly taking in hand the shining implement and</xml>
<xml>measuring the power of electricity, hidden in substances, should use it</xml>
<xml>carefully on the earth.</xml>
<xml>12. O learned person, with the skill of art, thou hast attained to</xml>
<xml>fame under the sun, thou art connected with air's mid-realm through</xml>
<xml>electricity thy asylum is on earth. Being the master of aeroplanes, go</xml>
<xml>ahead with nice well-balanced speed.</xml>
<xml>13. O artisan and his master, ye both, the bestowers of happiness</xml>
<xml>like the sun and air, harness electricity in this aeroplane, possessing the</xml>
<xml>speed of fire and water, seating and taking us afar.</xml>
<xml>14. O friends, in every deed and battle, we call for succour, our</xml>
<xml>King, the mightiest of all.</xml>
<xml>15. O King, thou whose paths are pleasant, with thy powerful</xml>
<xml>and devoted army, come, destroying the forces of thy wicked foes. Come,</xml>
<xml>overtaking the territories of the enemies. Spreading gladness all around,</xml>
<xml>accept the chieftainship of thy commander of the army, who makes the</xml>
<xml>enemies weep. Granting fearlessness to all thy subjects, speed through</xml>
<xml>the wide air.</xml>
<xml>11. Swami Dayananda gives its purport as such : People should know that electricity</xml>
<xml>exists in all substances just as it does in iron and stones. Having its full knowledge, and</xml>
<xml>using it well they should construct fiery instruments and aeroplanes.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XI 111</xml>
<xml>16. O learned person, just as we skillfully evolve from a part of</xml>
<xml>the earth, electricity, dear as breath, and the giver of comfort, and just</xml>
<xml>as we procure atmospheric electricity, dear as breath, and the giver of</xml>
<xml>comfort, so shouldst thou skillfully prepare electricity which like the</xml>
<xml>sun conduces to our comforts.</xml>
<xml>17. The first and foremost God illuminates the sun before twilight.</xml>
<xml>He also illuminates the days, and multiple beams of the sun. He alone</xml>
<xml>establishes the Heaven and Earth.</xml>
<xml>18. O learned King, just as a swift horse, having started on his</xml>
<xml>way, causes terror in all battles, and just as a householder wants to see</xml>
<xml>with his eyes, fire arranged in a beautiful place, so shouldst thou shake</xml>
<xml>all battles and spread knowledge to each house.</xml>
<xml>19. O learned King, according to thy desire, trample upon the</xml>
<xml>foes, hanker after sovereignty and knowledge, and having accepted us as</xml>
<xml>thy subjects on the earth, instruct us in geology and electricity ; so that</xml>
<xml>we may use that knowledge.</xml>
<xml>20. O learned King, thy humility and dealings are resplendent</xml>
<xml>like the sun, thy seat is firm like the Earth, thy soul is indestructible,</xml>
<xml>like the space, thy goal is vast like the ocean. Having measured thy</xml>
<xml>strength carefully attack the enemy with thy army.</xml>
<xml>21. O prosperous, learned person, just as we, the givers of wealth,</xml>
<xml>from the surrounding of each dwelling place of ours, exploring the</xml>
<xml>science of fire, acquire wisdom for worldly prosperity, so shouldst thou</xml>
<xml>elevate thy self.</xml>
<xml>22. O learned geologist, wealth-giver, just as a strong horse jumps</xml>
<xml>up, so should'st thou attain to greatness in this world; acquire absolute,</xml>
<xml>beautiful happiness free from pain, derivable from a saintly life. May we,</xml>
<xml>in the enjoyment of happiness, explore the pervading electricity full of</xml>
<xml>brilliance.</xml>
<xml>23. O seeker after knowledge, just as I with learning and ghee,</xml>
<xml>clearly manifest the properties of air, that pervades all substances, that</xml>
<xml>moves transversely, is vast in vitality, highly powerful with the oblations</xml>
<xml>of corn, vast in velocity, and visible, so I make thee also understand the</xml>
<xml>properties of air.</xml>
<xml>21. The verse can also be translated as such. "O 1 learned persons, ye are the givers</xml>
<xml>of wealth. Go forward from the present position for great prosperity. Digging, according to</xml>
<xml>your instructions from the bosom of the earth, the lustrous metals like gold, let us be devoted</xml>
<xml>to the good of humanity/*</xml>

<xml>his desire; So I, for the grandeur of man, manifest, with immaculate reason,</xml>

<xml>62. O learned woman, calm like the earth, seek some one else</xml>
<xml>besides our relatives of thievish and plundering nature. Don't wish for</xml>
<xml>an irreligious or uncharitable husband. Whatever course of action thou</xml>
<xml>choosest, may that succeed. To thee be homage.</xml>
<xml>63. O woman, the embodiment of true conduct, thine are the</xml>

<xml>CHAPTER XII 131</xml>
<xml>66. He alone is fit to lead a married life, who, like God, the</xml>
<xml>Creator of the universe, and master of eternal laws, keeps constant</xml>
<xml>company with his wife and behaves properly, who, like the sun, opposes</xml>
<xml>the warriors on the battle-field,</xml>
<xml>67. The intelligent ply the ploughs. The wise for the comfort of the</xml>
<xml>learned, carry the yokes in different directions.</xml>
<xml>68. O people, use various implements for cultivating the earth.</xml>
<xml>Employ ploughs and yokes. Sow seed in a well prepared field. With the</xml>
<xml>knowledge of the science of agriculture and full consideration, be quick</xml>
<xml>to sustain and nourish yourselves. May we get the corn fully grown and</xml>
<xml>ripened in the near fields.</xml>
<xml>69. Happily let the ploughshares turn up the plough land, happily</xml>
<xml>go the hard-working ploughers with the 'oxen. O air and sun, nourishing</xml>
<xml>the earth with water, cause ye our plants bear abundant fruit.</xml>
<xml>70. Approved by all the learned persons, strengthened and sprinkled</xml>
<xml>with water and milk, the furrow be balmed with butter and honey.</xml>
<xml>The furrow will give us ghee so we should water it again and again.</xml>
<xml>71. O farmers the keen-sheared plough, the bringer of bliss, the</xml>
<xml>protector of foodstuffs, moves awry. It is the giver of fast, comfortable</xml>
<xml>conveyances. With it dig the solid earth for protection's sake.</xml>
<xml>72. O cook, the preparer of palatable meals, please with thy</xml>

<xml>Grihasthi wage war with the enemies in a battle and subdue them. He should be brave like</xml>
<xml>a warrior, and not timid. Ju?t as God, with His constant law creates the universe, and</xml>
<xml>protects all men, so should the husband always remain in the company of his wife for her</xml>
<xml>portection and behave properly towards her.</xml>
<xml>67. Agriculture is considered to be highly essential for the good of humanity. The</xml>
<xml>learned should follow this profession, and grow more food by scientific methods of cultivation,</xml>
<xml>say the use of fertilizers and tractors.</xml>
<xml>This verse can be applied for yoga as well, and interpreted like this. The yogis concen-</xml>
<xml>trate on different organs through samadhi. Through Sushumna, they control their breaths in</xml>
<xml>different ways.</xml>
<xml>70. The orthodox commentators interpret Sita as the wife of Shri Ram Chandra. There</xml>
<xml>is no history in the vedas. This is a wrong interpretation. Sita is the furrow traced in a</xml>
<xml>field when it is ploughed. The furrow should be fed with milk, honey and water, so that it</xml>
<xml>may grow sweet, fresh, good and pleasant corn.</xml>
<xml>71. Plough is the instrument of agriculture, which gives us prosperity and wealth</xml>
<xml>wherewith we can buy comfortable conveyances like motor cars and aeroplanes.</xml>

<xml>receive the light of this sun, so should we.</xml>
<xml>74. We all should live together amicably, as the year lives with</xml>
<xml>its parts, the dawn with its ruddy beams, the husband and wife with their</xml>
<xml>wonderful achievements, the sun together with his dappled courser, the</xml>
<xml>air, the earth with water, and the lightning with its exact thunder.</xml>
<xml>75. May I know the herbs that were born three years ago in the</xml>
<xml>earth, that pervade all the 107 vital parts of the body of the patients.</xml>
<xml>76. O physicians imbued with manifold wisdom and deeds, protect</xml>
<xml>my body from disease, with medicines having hundred, and thousand</xml>
<xml>growths. Cure your bodies as well. Know the innumerable vital parts of</xml>
<xml>your body. O mother thou shouldst also do like this.</xml>
<xml>77. O people derive happiness by the use of herbs full of blossoms</xml>

<xml>discomforts.</xml>

<xml>unto thee in proximity, wholesome words. O active, virtuousson, may I,</xml>
<xml>your mother, enjoy your horse, cow, land, home, clothes and soul-force.</xml>
<xml>79. O souls, this unstable body like the decaying herbs is your</xml>
<xml>home. God has given ye abode in this ephemeral world like water on the</xml>
<xml>lotus-leaf. Enjoy this earth, nourish the body with food and medicine,</xml>
<xml>and attain to happiness.</xml>
<xml>80. O men go to places where there are herbs, just as kings go to</xml>
<xml>the battle-fields.</xml>
<xml>The sagacious physician, the slayer of fiendish ailments and chaser</xml>
<xml>of diseases, tells ye the qualities of the herbs. Take service from him</xml>
<xml>and them both.</xml>
<xml>81. May I know for the health of this patient, all medicines,</xml>
<xml>75. I : A physician.</xml>
<xml>Three years old : The herbs that grow to full maturity in three years ; and are fully</xml>
<xml>ripened.</xml>
<xml>One hundred and seven vital parts of this body as given in the text mean the several vital</xml>
<xml>parts in which the herbs pervade.</xml>
<xml>77. Just as swift horses help us in conquering foes, so do the medicinal herbs conquer</xml>
<xml>our diseases and physical discomforts.</xml>
<xml>80. Him : Physician.</xml>
<xml>Them : herbs.</xml>
<xml>81. I : Physiciaa.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XII 133</xml>
<xml>efficacious in nature, full of juice, rich in nourishments, and possessing</xml>
<xml>strength-giving power. May they all give me ease.</xml>
<xml>82. Oman, just as strong cows go forth from their stalls and feed</xml>
<xml>their calves, so do the healing virtues of the wealth-giving medicinal</xml>
<xml>herbs, used properly, strengthen thy body and soul.</xml>
<xml>83. O men, know the medicine that brings ye relief like the</xml>
<xml>mother. Like flowing streams pay back the debt of gratitude. Keep</xml>
<xml>afar whatever brings disease.</xml>
<xml>84. Just as a thief steals into the cattle-fold, by breaking through</xml>
<xml>the wall, so do all well-known healing plants, come out of the earth tearing</xml>
<xml>it asunder, and drive out from the body whatever malady there is.</xml>
<xml>85. When I, obtaining them beforehand, hold these medicinal</xml>
<xml>herbs within my hand, the root of life'-killing disease like tuberculosis</xml>
<xml>disappears.</xml>
<xml>86. O medicines, when ye creep in a patient part by part, joint by</xml>
<xml>joint, ye destroy his pulmonary disease, as a strong man destroys the</xml>
<xml>delicate bodily parts of the foe.</xml>
<xml>87. O physician, try to extirpate tuberculosis through well-regu-</xml>
<xml>lated nourishing diet, through control of breath (Pranayam) and through</xml>
<xml>medicines which fully relieve the patient of its pain.</xml>
<xml>88. O women discussing together the merits of the qualities of</xml>
<xml>medicines, follow these words of mine, that all medicines help each other.</xml>
<xml>Just as one helps the other, so should your teachress protect you.</xml>
<xml>89. Let fruitful and fruitless herbs, those that blossom and the</xml>
<xml>blossomless, created by God, relieve us from disease.</xml>
<xml>90. O learned persons, just as medicines .relieve me from sickness,</xml>
<xml>so should ye, relieve me from the curse's evil, the offence committed</xml>
<xml>towards the virtuous, violation of the orders of the xuler, and the entire</xml>
<xml>sin against the sages.</xml>
<xml>83. Any medicine or a physician that brings disease should be shunned.</xml>
<xml>Just as a flowing stream, into which the people throw their filth does them good by</xml>
<xml>watering their fields, so should you do good unto them in return* who are kind or nnkind to</xml>
<xml>you.</xml>
<xml>85. People should prepare medicines with their dexterous hands, and use them for</xml>
<xml>eradicating fell diseases.</xml>
<xml>I : Physician.</xml>
<xml>88. Mine : Physician's.</xml>
<xml>90. Curse :-The wishing of evil for others.</xml>
<xml>134 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>91. The learned talk about the medicines, that like the rays emana-</xml>
<xml>ting from the sun, come from an experienced physician. No disease shall</xml>
<xml>attack the man, whom, while he liveth, these pervade.</xml>
<xml>92. O woman, thou knowest fully all the herbs, whose King is</xml>
<xml>Soma, and which possess innumerable healing properties. Thou art most</xml>
<xml>advanced in their knowledge, prompt for the fulfilment of wishes, and</xml>
<xml>sweet to the heart.</xml>
<xml>93. O married man, God has created the various herbs, whose</xml>
<xml>king is Soma, that overspread the earth. With their aid, grant semen</xml>
<xml>for this woman, and spreacj the knowledge of these medicines</xml>
<xml>unto all.</xml>
<xml>94. O learned persons, collect all medicinal herbs, which are</xml>
<xml>known to ye, and which ye hear of, which are near at hand, or are found</xml>
<xml>at a distance. Advance the strength of the body with their use, and</xml>
<xml>impart their knowledge to this girl.</xml>
<xml>95. May not the herb I dig for some purpose, harm you, while</xml>
<xml>being dug. May our and your bipeds and quadrupeds be free from</xml>
<xml>disease by its use.</xml>

<xml>Upvedas : Arth Veda, Dhanur Veda, Ayur Veda, Gandharva Veda,</xml>
<xml>93. A novice, inexperienced person ignorant of the nature and qualities of herbs should</xml>
<xml>not dig them, so that they may not be destroyed. Expert and intelligent persons alone, hav-</xml>
<xml>ing some knowledge of the medicinal herbs, should dig them so that they may not be destroyed</xml>
<xml>and uprooted.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER xn</xml>
<xml>Strength for me, removes my ailments and gives me power, so should'st</xml>

<xml>Enveloper of ocean as it swells and surges, the Loftiest of all, Worthy</xml>
<xml>of adoration by humanity, and full of Majesty in space. Shine forth for</xml>
<xml>us with Omnipresence and Omniscience.</xml>
<xml>3. That God alone is Adorable, Who. in the beginning of the</xml>
<xml>universe, created everything, is wide ip expansion, Highest of all,</xml>
<xml>Effulgent, and Worthy of worship. The sun, moon and other worlds</xml>
<xml>in the atmosphere, stationed in their orbits, testify to His knowledge. He</xml>
<xml>pervades them all through His Omnipresence and comprehends the</xml>
<xml>visible and the invisible in space.</xml>
<xml>4. God, is the creator of the universe, its one Lord, the Sustainer</xml>
<xml>of luminous objects like the sun. He was present before the creation</xml>
<xml>of the world. He sustains the earth, the sun and this world. Let us</xml>
<xml>worship with full devotion of our soul, Him, the Embodiment of</xml>
<xml>happiness.</xml>
<xml>5. Seven forces realise Him. He engulfs this earth, the sun and</xml>
<xml>the sky. In His fullness, He favourably possesses happiness and energy.</xml>
<xml>Moving in Him, I willingly perceive complete pleasure.</xml>

<xml>May all the living creatures residing in the atmosphere, the sun and</xml>
<xml>roaming on the earth obtain food.</xml>
<xml>7. Supppress through arms the movements of dacoits and plunderers</xml>
<xml>who live in forests ; and lie hidden in unknown paths.</xml>
<xml>8. Subdue with arms, all these evil-minded persons, who genera-</xml>
<xml>lly remain hidden, and now and then appear in the day time, or walk</xml>
<xml>freely in the light of the sun, or dwell in waters.</xml>
<xml>2. This verse is the same as 1129, but with a quite different interpretation.</xml>

<xml>five pranas.</xml>
<xml>6. God supplies food to all creatures living on the earth in space and in the sun. This</xml>
<xml>means there are living creatures in the Sun, Mercury, Mars, Uranus, and Neptune etc., whom</xml>
<xml>God supplies sustenance, fltf does not mean serpent here, as Griffith interprets it, but moving</xml>
<xml>living creatures, as interpreted by Swami Dayananda.</xml>

<xml>earth well-ordered like a net. Thou art the extirpator of foes, attack</xml>
<xml>them like a king equipped with ministers and military paraphernalia.</xml>
<xml>Strengthening thy hold with most deadly weapons, facing and killing the</xml>
<xml>fiends, subdue them soon.</xml>
<xml>10. O Commander, specimen of morality, keep thy fast moving</xml>
<xml>brave soldiers, well disciplined in the army. Like the swift movements</xml>
<xml>of lightning, let them fall falcon-like on the enemies. With uninterrupted</xml>

<xml>11. O destroyer of foes like fire, put shackles on and speedily</xml>
<xml>punish the troublesome evil-minded enemy of yours and ours, may he be</xml>

<xml>Be famous in doing justice unto females, as thy husband does unto men.</xml>

<xml>earth. Thou, the organiser of household affairs, and the conductor of</xml>

<xml>19. O woman, may thy learned husband, protect thee, with</xml>
<xml>pleasure-giving deeds and beautiful peaceful acts, for full longevity,</xml>

<xml>with hundreds and thousands of joints and knots, so lengthen out our</xml>
<xml>line of descendants with sons and grandsons.</xml>

<xml>of bricks build and magnify a house, so dost thou increase our family with</xml>
<xml>hundreds of sons and grandsons, and profusely enrich it with thousands of</xml>
<xml>articles. We serve thee with nice presents.</xml>
<xml>22. O brilliant learned teachress, gladden us with all thy tastes, just</xml>
<xml>as lights in the sun, with their beams, spread brilliance all around. With</xml>
<xml>all those tastes make us always friendly towards the lovely famous person.</xml>
<xml>23. O learned persons, whatever love ye have got for the sun, the</xml>
<xml>cows and horses, with all that inculcate love in us, just as the teacher and</xml>
<xml>preacher incite our love for learning. O unbiassed learned examiner,</xml>
<xml>examine us.</xml>
<xml>24. The woman, who, filled with the light of different sorts of</xml>
<xml>knowledge, spreads learning, and the morally advanced person, who shines</xml>
<xml>like lightning, may both these husband and wife attain to happiness.</xml>
<xml>Live permanently like soul, with thy husband, who is learned and</xml>
<xml>godly in nature. O woman, thy husband, the guardian of his progeny,</xml>
<xml>establishes thee, endowed with learning on this earth, in a place of res-</xml>

<xml>Imbibe thou full knowledge.</xml>
<xml>25. Let the Chetra and Baisakh months, parts of spring, born of</xml>
<xml>heat, mutually inter-related, contribute to my prosperity. Let these</xml>
<xml>months be the source of happiness to all. In those months let sun and</xml>
<xml>earth, and water be pleasure-giving. Let medicinal herbs grow in them,</xml>
<xml>and heat be useful to us. O learned persons, wedded to truth, keeping</xml>
<xml>before ye in spring time, the fervent seekers after knowledge attain to</xml>
<xml>prosperity. Just as the sun and earth, through the dispensation of God,</xml>
<xml>steadfastly work together like breath, so should you wife and husband</xml>
<xml>live constantly together.</xml>
<xml>26. O wife, thou art unconquerable by foes. Being patient, tolerate</xml>
<xml>me thy husband. Possessing a thousand manly powers, anxious to oppose</xml>
<xml>an army, overpower the foes. Just as I keep thee satisfied so shouldst thou</xml>
<xml>keep me pleased.</xml>
<xml>27. In spring the zephyrs blow coolly like water, the rivers and</xml>
<xml>oceans flow calmly, and medicinal herbs are filled with sweet juice.</xml>
<xml>28. In spring the nights are sweet, the days are sweet, the terres-</xml>
<xml>trial atmosphere is sweet, and light, our protector, is sweet unto us.</xml>
<xml>29. In spring, let trees give us sweet fruits, sun physical strength</xml>
<xml>and cows sweet milk.</xml>
<xml>30. O man, in spring, seat thyself in the deepness of waters, lest</xml>
<xml>sun, lest heat burning in all men, should afflict thee. Let well-built</xml>
<xml>subjects be under thy control. Let highly useful rain pour. Think deeply</xml>
<xml>and favourably over these points.</xml>
<xml>31. O learned person, as sun, the protector of our vital organs, the</xml>
<xml>cause of rain, the sustainer of pleasant water, attains to all pleasure-giving</xml>
<xml>regions, the mainstay of achieving our desires on earth, space and sky, in</xml>
<xml>past, present and future, so shoulcht thou. Tread thou the path of virtue^</xml>
<xml>as did thy ancestors.</xml>
<xml>32. O mother and father just as the Mighty Sun and Earth nourish</xml>
<xml>the world, so shouldst ye desire for the completion of our noble task of</xml>
<xml>getting education and rear us full with nourishments.</xml>
<xml>23. Chetra is March-April. Vaishakha is April-May. The heat of these months is useful</xml>
<xml>to us in ripening the wheat crop.</xml>
<xml>29. TO3: may also mean rays of the sun and lands. They also give as pleasure,</xml>
<xml>32. This verse is the same as 8-32, but with a different meaning.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XIII 141</xml>
<xml>33. God is the adorable, inseparable companion of the soul ; which</xml>
<xml>realises through His grace the actions and laws of the Omnipresent God.</xml>
<xml>O man, ye should also observe them.</xml>
<xml>34. O woman, thou art firm, and the master of noble qualities. A</xml>
<xml>learned person is first born of thee, and afterwards is born of virtuous,</xml>
<xml>talented gurus. Thy husband, equipped with the knowledge conveyed by</xml>
<xml>the Gayatri, Trishtup, and Anushtup vedic verses ; improving his talent</xml>
<xml>thereby, derives learning worthy of exchange.</xml>
<xml>35. O man thou art self-effulgent through knowledge. O woman</xml>
<xml>thou art graceful through learning and virtuous conduct. Strive together</xml>
<xml>for knowledge, riches, strength, fame, food, heroism and offspring. I en-</xml>
<xml>join ye, to protect your bodies and foodstuffs, being sweet like the water</xml>
<xml>of a well, and observing the teachings of the vedas.</xml>
<xml>36. O learned, powerful person, verily harness thou thy steeds,</xml>
<xml>whicK are well disciplined and trained, and carry the conveyance with</xml>
<xml>full force in thy attacks on the foe with righteous indignation.</xml>
<xml>37. O learned person, trained by ancient scholars, and charitable in</xml>
<xml>nature ; yoke like a charioteer thy steeds, well disciplined by the experts.</xml>
<xml>Seat thyself on the seat of justice.</xml>
<xml>38. Just as rivers flow, so do speeches, purified in the inmost recesses</xml>
<xml>of the heart and mind, come out of the mouth of a learned person. I, full</xml>
<xml>of brilliance, acquire those speeches, coming like the fast-moving showers</xml>
<xml>of rain from the midst of lightning.</xml>
<xml>39. O learned person, thou hast acquired the knowledge of all</xml>
<xml>objects of the universe, and the wisdom of lightning-like brilliant persons</xml>
<xml>being lovely of all human beings. We resort to thee for praise, for love</xml>
<xml>for the acquisition of spiritual knowledge, and for the light of justice.</xml>
<xml>40. O learned person, thou art luminous like fire, with the light of</xml>
<xml>thy knowledge. Thou art the giver of knowledge with thy splendour.</xml>
<xml>Like gold thou art the giver of innumerable comforts. We pay homage</xml>
<xml>to thee for acquiring vast knowledge.</xml>
<xml>41. O learned person, just as lightning supports with water, the</xml>
<xml>sun, that measures innumerable objects, and exhibits the whole universe,</xml>
<xml>33. The verse is the same, as 6-4.</xml>
<xml>Actions : creation, sustenance and annihilation of the universe.</xml>
<xml>Laws : Righteousness and performance of noble deeds.</xml>
<xml>34. A man takes his physical birth from his mother, and spiritual birth from his guru the</xml>
<xml>teacher, hence he is called DwijanmS (twice born).</xml>
<xml>Worthy of exchange :-Knowledge is a commodity which is received, and imparted,</xml>
<xml>142 tfAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>and is worthy of praise, so shouldst thou purify the inmost recesses of thy</xml>
<xml>heart. With thy glowing strength keep afar all diseases. Making the</xml>

<xml>42. O learned person, in the vast space, harm not the wind's</xml>
<xml>impetuous rush, the bond of ocean-wide water, and the cloud the tawny</xml>
<xml>child of rivers.</xml>
<xml>43. O learned person just as I constantly search for electricity,</xml>
<xml>newly produced, full of accomplishments, creator of foodstuffs, pure like</xml>
<xml>water, powerful like the horse, knowable by the highly learned, and</xml>
<xml>using it skilfully in each season, do not harm the indivisible beautiful</xml>
<xml>earth, so thou shouldst not harm electricity and this earth.</xml>
<xml>44. O learned person, residing in the supreme Lord, vast like the</xml>
<xml>space, harm not the vast Earth, attracted by the sun, the repository of</xml>
<xml>water, created by the Pre-eminent God, the Giver of countless fruits, and</xml>
<xml>the Cause of our protection, nor harm the lightning, the precursor of the</xml>
<xml>clouds.</xml>
<xml>45. O learned person, may thy displeasure spare the fire that has</xml>
<xml>its being from the heat of the Earth, or from the lightning of the sun,</xml>
<xml>whereby the Omnific Lord engenders creatures.</xml>
<xml>46. God is Wonderful and Powerful amongst all material objects.</xml>
<xml>He is the Manifestor of Pran, Udan, and fire. He pervades the air,</xml>
<xml>earth and heaven. He is the Creator and Sustainer of all that moveth</xml>
<xml>and moveth not.</xml>
<xml>47. O King, born as man, and wide-awake, possessing thousand-</xml>
<xml>fold vision, progressing for the attainment of happiness, don't destroy</xml>
<xml>the bipeds and quadrupeds, and useful denizens of the ' forest ; but</xml>
<xml>protect them. Increase thy wealth with those cattle, and possess a</xml>
<xml>strong body. The injurious beast of the forest should be put to grief by</xml>
<xml>thee. Let thy enemy, whom we dislike, be put to grief.</xml>
<xml>48. O King, don't destroy -this one-hoofed beautiful horse, soon</xml>
<xml>42. Learned persons through the performance of yajnas should get timely rain, and there-</xml>
<xml>by prolong their life.</xml>
<xml>43. In the text all commentators use 'jtffafrcl'-t DU t Maharshi Dayananda uses the word</xml>
<xml>tjsfafal I</xml>
<xml>45. This verse can be translated thus as well :</xml>
<xml>O learned person, don't show disrespect to God, Who is more learned than a yogi, more</xml>
<xml>illuminating than the luminous sun and beautiful earth, who creates all creatures.</xml>
<xml>48. I :-God.</xml>
<xml>A king should protect the useful, and tame beasts of the forest, and subdue the wild and</xml>
<xml>ferocious ones.</xml>
<xml>Qne hoofed .-Having one hoof in each foot,</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER Xft! 143</xml>
<xml>agitated and writhing with pain in battlefields. I point out to thee the</xml>
<xml>forest rhinoceros. With his protection add to thy prosperity and physical</xml>
<xml>strength. Let the wild and uncontrolled rhinoceros be put to grief</xml>
<xml>by thee. Let thy enemy, whom we detest, bs put to grief.</xml>
<xml>49. O sagacious King, in this world, don't harm this bull, the</xml>
<xml>giver of thousands of comforts, the source of immense milk, and worthy</xml>
<xml>of protection. Harm not in God's creation, the cow, the giver of milk</xml>
<xml>for mankind, and innocent in nature. I point out to thee the forest cow.</xml>
<xml>With her destruction add to thy prosperity and physical strength in the</xml>
<xml>midst of vast space and under God's guidance. Let the wild forest cow</xml>
<xml>be put to grief by thee. Let thy foe, whom we dislike, be put to</xml>
<xml>grief.</xml>
<xml>50. O learned King, don't kill the two-footed men and birds, and</xml>
<xml>four-footed cattle, the source of comforts. Don't kill the sheep that</xml>
<xml>covers our bodies with blankets, and is foremost worthy of protection</xml>
<xml>amongst God's creatures. I point out to thee the forest camel. With</xml>
<xml>his protection add to thy prosperity and physical strength. Let the wild,</xml>
<xml>uncontrollable camel be put to grief by thee. Let thy foe, whom we</xml>
<xml>dislike be put to grief.</xml>
<xml>51. The unborn soul is educated through the power of God. He</xml>
<xml>then sees God, existing before the creation of the universe, and the</xml>
<xml>Generator of all. The learned, through that soul, attain to pre-eminent</xml>
<xml>godly life ; and the virtuous to an exalted position. I point out to thee,</xml>
<xml>O king, the forest porcupine. Utilising her add to thy prosperity and</xml>
<xml>physical strength. Let the untamed porcupine be put to grief by thee.</xml>
<xml>Let thy foe, whom we dislike be put to grief by thee.</xml>
<xml>52. O most youthful leader, protect the pleasure-giving persons,</xml>
<xml>hear their songs. With thy soul, protect their offspring.</xml>
<xml>53. O man, I give thee the knowledge of the moving air for the</xml>
<xml>medicinal herbs filled with the wetness of water, clouds, brilliant elec-</xml>
<xml>tricity, open space, control of breath, fleeting mind, acquirable speech,</xml>
<xml>a well-furnished house, ear that hears various sounds, the sky and mid</xml>
<xml>50. I :-God.</xml>
<xml>Even the wild forest beasts like camel, cow, rhinoceros should be tamed, protected and</xml>
<xml>utilised, but the ferocious and uncontrollable destroyed.</xml>
<xml>51. A j means the eternal soul and goat. The goat should not be killed. The pofcupine</xml>
<xml>which is uncontrollable should be destroyed, but not the one that can be tamed.</xml>
<xml>I .-God.</xml>
<xml>53. I i-Teacher or God.</xml>
<xml>The teacher teaches his pupil different sciences, to equip him fully with knowledge.</xml>
<xml>144 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>region full of water, ocean full of water, sandy tracts of water, foodstuffs</xml>
<xml>that grow through water. I preach unto thee the significance of vedic</xml>
<xml>texts couched in Gayatri, Trishtup, Jagati, Anushtup, and Pankti metres.</xml>
<xml>54. O wife, this fire is primordial. It is the cause of Pran (breath),</xml>
<xml>the source of life. Spring is the result of Pran. Spring is the cause of</xml>
<xml>Gayatri, whereby we sing the praise of God. From the Gayatri comes</xml>
<xml>the Gayatri metre. From the Gayatri comes the prayer. From the prayer</xml>
<xml>come action, contemplation, and knowledge (Karma, Upasana and Jnana).</xml>
<xml>As the fruit of these three comes the pleasure of liberation</xml>
<xml>(Moksha). A learned person is the cause of producing intense pleasure</xml>
<xml>like Pran. Thou accept me as thy husband, the protector of progeny.</xml>
<xml>I gain strength to create offspring from thee.</xml>
<xml>55. O wife, in the south resides this air, the source of all acts.</xml>
<xml>From that air the doer of all deeds, comes the mind. From the heat of</xml>
<xml>the mind comes the summer. The eulogiser of summer is the Trishtup</xml>
<xml>metre. From the warmth of Trishtup comes the intense glow. From the</xml>
<xml>intense glow comes the mid-day. From mid-day comes the day of the</xml>
<xml>full moon. From that comes the ear the organ of receiving and strength-</xml>
<xml>ening knowledge. Just as a king, with his knowledge, administers justice</xml>
<xml>to his subjects, so do I, with thee, cultivate a contemplative mind for the</xml>
<xml>people.</xml>
<xml>56. O wife, this sun rising in the East goes to the west, illuminat-</xml>
<xml>ing the universe. The lustrous rays of the sun are its eyes. The eye</xml>
<xml>enjoys the rainy season. The Jagati verse is the expositor of the rainy</xml>
<xml>season. From Jagati is derived the knowledge of vedic verses. From that</xml>
<xml>knowledge comes prosperity. From prosperity we get the knowledge of</xml>
<xml>seventeenfold powerful soul. From that knowledge comes the knowledge</xml>
<xml>of different phases and objects of the world. The eye makes us receive</xml>
<xml>light.</xml>
<xml>Just as a husband, the guardian of offspring attains to discerning</xml>
<xml>knowledge with his educated wife, so do I with thee gain power from</xml>
<xml>the world.</xml>
<xml>54. In spring Gayatri verses are generally recited.</xml>
<xml>Vasishtha Rishi : Pran.</xml>
<xml>Moksha : Emancipation, salvation.</xml>
<xml>55. The subtle connection between the things mentioned has not been understood by me.</xml>
<xml>Bhardwaj Rishi means ear and is not the name of a Rishi.</xml>
<xml>56. Jamadagni Rishi means eye, and is not the name of any person, vide Shatapatha</xml>
<xml>8-1-2-3. The verse is not fully understood by me. Seventeen fold powerful means posseesing</xml>
<xml>various powers. Vide Shatapatha 8-1-2-4.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XIll 145</xml>
<xml>57. O wife, this North direction is the giver of comforts. Ear is</xml>
<xml>the source of its pleasantness. The ear is related to autumn. The</xml>
<xml>significant Anushtap verse is the expositor of autumn. From Anushtap</xml>
<xml>is derived the verse that explains speech. From that verse is derived</xml>
<xml>the means of churniLg the objects. From that means is derived the</xml>
<xml>principle of perfecting twenty one sciences. From that principle, we</xml>
<xml>derive the ear, the cause of friendship with all, the receiver of the</xml>
<xml>significance of words, the manifestor of various objects, and listener to</xml>
<xml>the singing of Sama Veda. I, thy husband, the guardian of the offspring,</xml>
<xml>along with thee, use the ear for the good of the people.</xml>
<xml>58. O learned wife, the highest of all things is intellect. From</xml>
<xml>intellect is born speech. Winter is the offspring of speech. The Pankti</xml>
<xml>verse is the expositor of winter. From Pankti springs Nidhanvat a part</xml>
<xml>of Sama Veda, that comments on the mystery of Death. From that springs</xml>
<xml>knowledge, the source of acquisition. From that knowledge are "derived</xml>
<xml>the twelve and thirty three songs of the Sama Veda. With those songs,</xml>
<xml>knowing strength and the objects that contribute to wealth, the door of</xml>
<xml>noble deeds and the master of vedic lore, behaves rightly. I, thy husband,</xml>
<xml>the guardian of offspring, with thee, acquire speech full of knowledge</xml>
<xml>and sound instructions.</xml>

<xml>of water. Thou art full of pleasures, and givest them to others. Settle</xml>
<xml>in thy house on this earth. The Rudras and vasus instruct thee. Imbibe</xml>
<xml>these vedic instructions for the auspiciousness. May the learned teachers</xml>
<xml>and preachers, themselves admirers of pure domestic life, settle thee</xml>
<xml>in it.</xml>
<xml>3. O woman, just as the master of forces and employees, with</xml>
<xml>their aid, standing in the midst of learned persons, advances for battle and</xml>
<xml>pleasure, so shouldst thou advance in this world. Just as a father looks to</xml>
<xml>the comforts of his son, so shouldst thou. With pleasure adorning</xml>
<xml>thy body with clothes and ornaments enter bodily the domestic life with</xml>
<xml>thy husband. May the teachers and preachers, themselves admirers of</xml>
<xml>pure domestic life, settle thee in it.</xml>

<xml>the protectrixof the earth, handsome and well-named ; full of butter and</xml>
<xml>other good edibles. May all the learned persons revere thee. Stay in</xml>
<xml>this domestic life. Give us wealth that produces good children. May</xml>
<xml>the learned teachers and preachers, themselves admirers of pure domestic</xml>

<xml>noble deeds, establish thee on the surface of the earth, as mistress of the</xml>
<xml>house, thee, the recipient of deathless mental knowledge, the mainstay of</xml>
<xml>all directions, the guardian of the house, the place of hearing children.</xml>
<xml>I establish thee on the earth like the rays of sun, as mistress of the house.</xml>
<xml>Thou art pleasant like the wave of waters. May the learned teachers and</xml>

<xml>vyan through different nice devices. Illumine my eye. Fill my ear with</xml>
<xml>religious sermons. Strengthen my vital breaths. Get medicinal plants.</xml>
<xml>Protect bipeds. Protect quadrupeds. Manage well the household affairs,</xml>
<xml>as sun, with its brilliance pours the rain.</xml>
<xml>9. The Brahman is foremost in the society, like head in the body.</xml>
<xml>His force lies in the protection of humanity through knowledge, religion</xml>
<xml>and austerity. The Kshatriya is a class amongst men. His power lies</xml>
<xml>in affording happiness to humanity through justice, humility and strength.</xml>
<xml>The Vaishya is another class, who amasses foodstuffs. His strength lies</xml>
<xml>in becoming the lord of riches. The artisan, Shudra is another class of</xml>
<xml>men, whose strength lies in doing hard work.</xml>

<xml>of managing the affairs of the State, should like the earth take upon him-</xml>
<xml>self the burden of all enterprises. _</xml>
<xml>It is the duty of a man, strong like an ox, to protect his subjects and</xml>
<xml>treat all straightly and justly.</xml>
<xml>It is the duty of a person well-known for his intellect and honour, to</xml>

<xml>CHAPTER XIV 149</xml>
<xml>10. Like the bull that conveys the cart, the physically developed</xml>
<xml>person should ripen his semen and undertake duties of a house-holder.</xml>
<xml>The souls that like the milch-cow nourish others, are fit to rear the world.</xml>
<xml>The master of the three vedas should praise God through action,</xml>
<xml>contemplation and knowledge.</xml>
<xml>The person brilliant like the sun, should through eminence and know-</xml>
<xml>ledge illumine himself and others. He who controls his five organs, can</xml>
<xml>control his five breaths. He, who is engrossed in action, contemplation</xml>
<xml>and knowledge, is fit to eradicate his sins.</xml>
<xml>He who knows all the four vedas, constantly prays to God.</xml>
<xml>11. O husband and wife, behaving like lightning and earth, with</xml>
<xml>mature intellect, make your domestic life cemented like a brick. Just as</xml>
<xml>the sun and earth with their might restrict the atmosphere, so should ye</xml>
<xml>bind your foes and remove miseries. O man just as thou removest the</xml>
<xml>affliction of thy wife, so shouldst she remove thine.</xml>
<xml>12. O woman, may thy husband well-versed in doing various noble</xml>
<xml>deeds, fix in his heart thee, full of reverence, praiseworthy knowledge,</xml>
<xml>and vast store of learning. Thou shouldst offer water to all, for the safety</xml>
<xml>of their Pran, Vyan, Udan, and Saman, for their prosperity and preser-</xml>
<xml>vation of character. Increase the store of laudable, pure water. Don't</xml>
<xml>destroy the sweet and disease-uprooting water. May thy husband, loving</xml>
<xml>thee like life, keep thee safe with great well-being, his splendour and</xml>
<xml>pleasant knowledge. Live constantly with thy godly husband like the</xml>
<xml>soul.</xml>

<xml>Like the vast upper and lower directions, thou hast been made the mistress</xml>
<xml>of the house. Please thou thy husband and other relatives.</xml>
<xml>14. O woman, may thy husband, the doer of various noble deeds,</xml>
<xml>establish like sun-light on water, in his heart, thee, full of knowledge.</xml>
<xml>Grant full light to all the members of the family for strengthening their</xml>
<xml>Pran, Apan, Vyan. Thy husband dear like vital breath, is thy Lord.</xml>

<xml>15. Shravan (July-August) and Bhadrapada (August-September)</xml>
<xml>constitute the rainy season, and they contribute to my prosperity. In them</xml>
<xml>there is the touch of heat and cold.</xml>
<xml>Just as the Sky and Earth thrive in these months, so shouldst ye,</xml>
<xml>husband and wife, prosper with your enjoyment.</xml>
<xml>Just as waters, plants and fires separately thrive in the rainy season,</xml>
<xml>so should noble persons, with unanimity of purpose, and sameness of</xml>
<xml>knowledge, prosper.</xml>
<xml>Just as the Sky and Earth thrive in the rainy season, so should learned</xml>
<xml>persons utilizing the rainy season for their comfort, come in contact with</xml>

<xml>and affectionately like breath.</xml>

<xml>ber) constitute the Autumn season. Both these months contribute to my</xml>
<xml>enjoyable comforts. In them there is the touch of heat and cold. Let</xml>
<xml>them make the Sky and Earth thrive. Let waters and plants grow by</xml>
<xml>their means. Let the fires of our body that regulate all actions function</xml>
<xml>separately. Let the learned people enter these two months gloriously,</xml>
<xml>desiring for happiness. O husband and wife live together firmly like</xml>

<xml>18. Wisdom gives pleasure. Intellect grants strength. Discern-</xml>
<xml>ment gives freedom. Food gives physical force. Yoga with five</xml>
<xml>components gives light. Affection gives fame. Matter affords shelter.</xml>
<xml>Intense attachment to pleasure creates sexual enjoyment. The mani-</xml>
<xml>festation of different sciences gives knowledge. The worshipper of God</xml>
<xml>knows Him. Dependence on physical, mental, and spiritual enjoyments</xml>
<xml>gives happiness. The force that rules the universe is the source of</xml>
<xml>strength and pleasure. People should take advantage of these and add</xml>
<xml>to their store of happiness.</xml>
<xml>19. Earth is full of freedom. Heaven is extremely pleasant.</xml>
<xml>Light is knowlege. Years enhance our wisdom. The stars are free in</xml>

<xml>studies. I accept thee.</xml>
<xml>Thou art riches, for riches do I accept thee. Thou art brilliance,</xml>
<xml>for brilliance do I accept thee.</xml>
<xml>9. O husband, thou knowest the primordial matter with three</xml>
<xml>qualities. For knowing that matter, do I accept thee.</xml>
<xml>Thou knowest this world the effect of matter. For knowing this</xml>
<xml>world do I accept thee. Thou art the manifold benefactor of the world.</xml>
<xml>I accept thee for doing good to humanity. Thou knowest all objects</xml>
<xml>similar in nature. For knowing them do I accept thee.</xml>

<xml>10. O Woman thou art queen brilliant like the East. Eight Vasus</xml>
<xml>are thy protectors. Thou possessest the fire that resides in arms and</xml>
<xml>weapons, that pervades the sun, lightning and Earth, and is full of praise.</xml>
<xml>Get butter on the Earth for enjoyment. For thy prosperity, possess the</xml>
<xml>military force of aeroplanes. May the aged vedic seers, with great</xml>
<xml>power, and brilliance of knowledge, fill thee with good qualities and</xml>
<xml>wisdom. This husband of thine is thy protector in diverse ways. May</xml>
<xml>all the learned persons, unanimously settle thee and thy husband in a</xml>
<xml>happy place on this comfortable Earth.</xml>
<xml>9. Three qualities : The matter has got three qualities of Satva, Rajas, Tamas.</xml>
<xml>10. Vasus : The eight forces of nature mentioned before,</xml>
<xml>158 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>11. O woman thou art like the bright South. Eleven Rudras</xml>
<xml>(airs) are thy protectors. Thy husband, the wielder of arms and</xml>
<xml>weapons, the knower of the meanings of vedic verses in fifteen ways,</xml>
<xml>and the sun serve thee on earth. He, being fearless of man, preaches</xml>
<xml>unto thee firmly the narrable and instructible words.</xml>
<xml>For stability he recites the significant verses of the Sama Veda.</xml>
<xml>The aged, learned persons, the significant plenteous airs in beautiful</xml>
<xml>objects in the atmosphere, and the particles of blazing fire make thee</xml>
<xml>renowned. The sustainer and nourisher of the Earth through attraction,</xml>
<xml>the sun, the foremost amongst the brilliant objects, strengthens thee.</xml>
<xml>May all the learned persons, unanimously establish thee and thy</xml>
<xml>husband in a happy place in the space, where there is plenty of</xml>
<xml>water.</xml>
<xml>12. O woman, thou art brilliant like the West. The learned</xml>
<xml>persons are thy overlords. Thy husband, possessing seventeen vital</xml>
<xml>parts of the body, worthy of praise, the subduer of foes, master of fiery</xml>
<xml>spirits, may serve thee on earth.</xml>
<xml>May he, unfaltering in nature, full of instructions from many</xml>
<xml>learned persons, and vedic lore, full of various teachings of great men,</xml>
<xml>learn the Sama Veda for greatness.</xml>
<xml>There are in the atmosphere many lustrous objects, created from</xml>
<xml>the limitless material cause, and serviceable moving airs spread in all</xml>
<xml>parts. The learned should instruct thee so. The master of riches, the</xml>
<xml>king, keeps the people contented, so should all learned persons unani-</xml>
<xml>mously establish thee and thy husband in a happy abode, in a part of the</xml>
<xml>earth, free from affliction.</xml>
<xml>13. O woman, Just as North is self luminous, so is thy husband.</xml>
<xml>The beautiful airs are the presiding forces of the North.</xml>
<xml>May thy husband worthy of praise like the moon that preserves</xml>
<xml>rays in twenty one ways, live with thee on this earth.</xml>
<xml>Being free from the sway of passions, may he, for thee, learn that</xml>
<xml>part of the veda which deals with the unity of God. For stability, may</xml>
<xml>he study that portion of the Sama Veda, that deals with the universal</xml>
<xml>11. Fifteen : Five organs of knowledge (Gyan Indriya) and five of action (Karma Indriyas)</xml>
<xml>and five airs, Fran, Apan, Vyan, Udan and Saman.</xml>
<xml>12. Seventeen. Pt. Jai Dev, Vidya Alankar, in his commentary describes seventeen to</xml>
<xml>be 17 parts of the body, i.e , 10 fingers, two arms, two legs, head, belly and soul. Seventeen</xml>
<xml>may also mean food vide clto 2-7-7.</xml>
<xml>13 Twenty-one : The real significance of this number is not clear- In Tandya Brahman</xml>
<xml>Granth it is written $rft*33>f$3T: I 16-3-4. According to this Brahman, Twentyone means great-</xml>
<xml>ness, superiority.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XV 159</xml>
<xml>aspect of God. In thy body there are many chief strong vital airs, in</xml>
<xml>the organs, coupled with perception. He is the sustainer and lord of</xml>
<xml>those airs.</xml>
<xml>May all the learned persons, with one mind make thee renowned,</xml>
<xml>and establish thee and thy husband in a happy place on a comfortable</xml>
<xml>part of the earth.</xml>
<xml>14. O woman, thou art the lady paramount like the lofty region.</xml>
<xml>All the shining bodies like the sun, are thy protectors. May thy husband,</xml>
<xml>like the sun, the guardian of the world, and the sustainer of big planets,</xml>
<xml>adore thee. For freedom from pain on this earth, through twenty-seven</xml>
<xml>and thirty-three means of praise, let all the learned persons, knowing the</xml>
<xml>sciences of fire and air, resort to two parts of the veda. For progress let</xml>
<xml>them have knowledge of the two parts of the Sama Veda, with verses in</xml>
<xml>Shakvari and Raivati metres.</xml>
<xml>Just as in the atmosphere, the first-born minute and bulky airs like</xml>
<xml>Dhananjaya etc. residing in divine objects, make thee renowned, so should</xml>
<xml>people make them known. This sun, the lord, and sustainer of all in</xml>
<xml>diverse ways, and the learned persons with one mind establish thee and</xml>
<xml>thy husband in a happy house on a comfortable part of the earth.</xml>
<xml>15. In the East there are golden-tressed sunbeams. There are</xml>
<xml>other beams also, which work like a wise driver and horses of a convey-</xml>
<xml>ance, and like the head of an army and a village chieftain.</xml>
<xml>Their chief direction and sub-direction, both are called Apsaras</xml>
<xml>that move in the Pranas. Let injurious animals like lions and others that</xml>
<xml>eat flesh and grass be destroyed. Let murderous crowds of men that destroy</xml>
<xml>others like a powerful weapon, be killed. Let virtuous rulers protect us</xml>
<xml>from those animals, and make us comfortable. In the jaws of these</xml>
<xml>animals we place the ferocious man whom we hate and who hates us.</xml>
<xml>16. O men, this vishvakarma breeze blows in the south. These</xml>
<xml>two kinds of air, that give sound like the sound of a chariot, and</xml>
<xml>are the doers of wonderous acts like a chariot, are like the head</xml>
<xml>of an army and the chieftain of a village, which help meditation, and</xml>
<xml>14. The word (ViqsKjfra'sft meaning twenty-seven and thirty-three has not been</xml>
<xml>understood. No commentator has thrown light on it. Tandva Brahman Granth describes</xml>
<xml>twenty-seven to mean strength and thirty-three to mean rain, vide crfo 10-1-15, 16-10-10.</xml>
<xml>15. Just as the driver and horses work in unison, and the militajy and civil powers work</xml>
<xml>together, so do the different airs.</xml>
<xml>Ap?aras : Two airs that course through our veins.</xml>
<xml>Their '.sunbeams.</xml>
<xml>16. Apsaras, Two kinds of air which blow in the atmosphere.</xml>
<xml>Vishvakarma. Air with which all actions are performed.</xml>
<xml>160 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>arc born together, are called Apsaras which live in the atmosphere.</xml>
<xml>Those who tease the people should be destroyed. Those who commit</xml>
<xml>unrighteous deeds should be subdued through arms. Use weapons against</xml>
<xml>those who torment mankind. Let just rulers protect us and make us</xml>
<xml>comfortable. In the lion-like jaws of these airs we place the depraved</xml>
<xml>man whom we hate and who hates us.</xml>
<xml>17. O men, there is all pervading lightning in the West. Like the</xml>
<xml>head of the army and the village chieftain, are its Rathprota, and</xml>
<xml>Asamaratha, Both these Apsaras, active beams in the atmosphere, dry all</xml>
<xml>the medicinal plants, and shed lustre.</xml>
<xml>Those who like tigers and serpents torture mankind, should be</xml>
<xml>subdued through arms. Let the rulers protect us from these animals and</xml>
<xml>make us comfortable. In the jaws of these animals we place the degraded</xml>
<xml>man whom we hate and who hates us.</xml>
<xml>18. In the North, the autumn is associated with the yajna. Its</xml>
<xml>Aswin and Kartik are like the head of the army and the village chieftain.</xml>
<xml>The fire that pervades the universe and the fire that receives ghee</xml>
<xml>(butter) are its Apsaras, i.e., the motion of the Pranas. In this season</xml>
<xml>water is in abundance, and air highly pleasant, Those who enjoy this air</xml>
<xml>properly deserve honour. May they protect us and make us comfortable,</xml>
<xml>In the jaws of destructive power of water and air, we place the man whom</xml>
<xml>we hate and who hates us.</xml>
<xml>19. This one direction above, is the source of wealth after rains.</xml>
<xml>Its army conqueror and well-armed lords are both Margshirsh and Paush</xml>
<xml>months of winter, like the head of an army and the village chieftain. The</xml>
<xml>internal fire that is the cause of eating much, and intellect the recipient of</xml>
<xml>eternal knowledge are two forces that reside in the Pranas. Thundering</xml>
<xml>is its weapon and lightning its missile-weapon. We offer food to persons</xml>
<xml>who are our guardians like them. May they protect us and make us com-</xml>
<xml>fortable. We place in the jaws of thunder and lightning the man whom</xml>
<xml>we hate and who hates us.</xml>
<xml>17. Rathaprota : Beautiful, lustrous air.</xml>
<xml>A?amaratha : Peerless air.</xml>
<xml>Both the haters deserve punishment.</xml>
<xml>According to Jai Chand Vidya Alankar. Rathaprota and Asamaratha are two military</xml>
<xml>Commanders. Rathprota is he who fights always sitting in the chariot. Asamaratha is he</xml>
<xml>whose chariot is unparalleled.</xml>
<xml>i. K- K HatC iD the Sense o enmit y- with a view to d barm or injury</xml>
<xml>is prohibited by the vedas, which preach love for all. Both the haters deserve punishment.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XV J61</xml>
<xml>iO. This Agni, resides between the Earth and Heaven, like head in</xml>
<xml>the shape of the Sun. Being the protector of all directions, it satisfies the</xml>
<xml>forces of our breaths.</xml>
<xml>21. This fire in winter, present in thousands of nice objects, and</xml>
<xml>possessing hundreds of characteristics, is the lord of foodgrains and riches,</xml>
<xml>and beautiful like the head.</xml>
<xml>22. O learned person, I instruct thee that a harmless, wise scholar,</xml>
<xml>dispels ignorance with instructive speech, creates fire from the atmosphere,</xml>
<xml>or by churning, and is mighty like the head.</xml>
<xml>23. O learned person, this visible fire, with its properties of</xml>
<xml>alliance and division, full of blissful flames, helps in the performance of</xml>
<xml>yajna, and worldly deeds. It imbibes in its lustrous nature the lofty</xml>
<xml>sun.</xml>
<xml>It stimulates the pleasant speech worthy of acceptance and giver</xml>
<xml>of enjoyments.</xml>
<xml>Like fire, the learned person, full of noble qualities should</xml>
<xml>preach all sciences.</xml>
<xml>24. With fuel the fire is kindled. Just as calf is pleased seeing</xml>
<xml>the cow coming, so are people delighted by seeing the Dawn. Just as</xml>
<xml>highly religious people fairly well resort to permanent devices of happi-</xml>
<xml>ness, so do the rays wholly attain to heaven.</xml>
<xml>25. Let us use respectful language for a person, who is pure, in-</xml>
<xml>telligent, wise, strong, and virtuous. Let him who expounds the vedic</xml>
<xml>lore, humbly divulge the praises of the Effulgent God, as the sun seated</xml>
<xml>in its rays, sheds in heaven the lustre that spreads to various places.</xml>
<xml>26. In this world, this visible fire, serviceable in works of protection,</xml>
<xml>worthy of investigation, the paramount accomplisher of sacrifice (yajna),</xml>
<xml>the recipient of ghee, and ubiquitous, is acknowledged by the learned. The</xml>
<xml>beautiful persons, adequately advanced in knowledge expound for all people</xml>
<xml>this fire pervading the beams wondrously.</xml>
<xml>27. Fire, the guardian of the created world, ever active, full of</xml>
<xml>strength, developing with ghee, and pure, is born for fresh prosperity.</xml>
<xml>Illumined by the suns, it glitters with the intense touch of light.</xml>
<xml>28. O learned person, dear like life, thou shinest with knowledge,</xml>
<xml>like fire with attrition,</xml>
<xml>22, I; Acharya.</xml>
<xml>23. See Yajur 13-15.</xml>
<xml>27. Suns. --There 'are various sUns in the solar system. The one We see is tot th6 plane"*</xml>
<xml>Earth, but there are other planets also.</xml>
<xml>162 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>Fire, highly serviceable, residing in the inmost recesses of out</xml>
<xml>heart, present in all rays and objects, is called the son of highly strong and</xml>
<xml>powerful air. The learned master it. I preach unto thee its significance.</xml>
<xml>29. O men, just as the learned, your associates, offer seemly</xml>
<xml>oblations and praises to fire, supreme, and highly powerful, behaving as</xml>
<xml>your grandson, so should you proceed with it.</xml>
<xml>30. O mighty, enlightened vaishya, having adequate trade relations</xml>
<xml>with others, and worthy of adoration, thou lookest graceful, seated in a</xml>
<xml>desirable position of vantage ; bring us all riches.</xml>
<xml>31. O noble learned person, loved of many, people invoke thee,</xml>
<xml>powerful like the scorching rays of the sun for acquiring necessary nice</xml>
<xml>foodstuffs for the subjects.</xml>
<xml>32. Omen, just as I acknowledge for ye, through desirable food-</xml>
<xml>grains, Agni, steadfast in nature, lovely, giver of life, devoid of conscious-</xml>
<xml>ness, united with harmless usages, eternal in nature, world's messenger,</xml>
<xml>and your enterprises, so should ye do for me.</xml>
<xml>33. I acknowledge the immortal sun, the warmer of the universe.</xml>
<xml>I acknowledge the immortal fire present in water, the scorcher of all</xml>
<xml>objects of the world,</xml>
<xml>The protector of the universe, this beautiful fire is present in all</xml>
<xml>things, It acts as a uniting force. Well-comprehended, it courses through</xml>
<xml>the body. The learned should realise it.</xml>
<xml>34. Agni moves like an invited friend. It goes like an invited</xml>
<xml>scholar. Use properly the fire, that is the desired treasure of persons and</xml>
<xml>29. Grandson : Just as a grandson is helpful and serviceable to the parents, so is fire</xml>
<xml>useful and serviceable to the learned.</xml>
<xml>30. Vaishya : A trader, businessman, merchant, representing the third division of men,</xml>
<xml>the first two being Brahmana and Kshatriya.*</xml>
<xml>32. World's messenger : Agni movei in the whole world, and puts life in it.</xml>
<xml>Foodgrains : Agni through yajna brings rain, which produces foodgrains. Agni is thus</xml>
<xml>the source of ripening the harvest.</xml>
<xml>Eternal in nature : It is eternal in its cau^e the Matter, not in itself.</xml>
<xml>Agni : Fire, Electricity.</xml>
<xml>I: Acharya.</xml>
<xml>33. There are two kind? of fire the rough and the subtle,</xml>
<xml>The repetition of the words in the first line of the verse, denotes the double nature</xml>
<xml>of fire.</xml>
<xml>34. Just as a scholar of the vedas, who is calm and affable is liked by all, so fire is liked</xml>
<xml>by all persons. JuU as an invited friend and an invited le&rned person go hastily so does fire</xml>
<xml>move quickly.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XV 163</xml>
<xml>material objects, like the master of the four vedas, companionable and</xml>
<xml>calm in nature.</xml>
<xml>35. O son of a strong man, possessing knowledge of the objects</xml>
<xml>created, dignified and well-read, thou like fire, with land and laudable</xml>
<xml>cow, art the master of foodgrains. Vouchsafe great wealth unto us.</xml>
<xml>36. O ruler equipped with a good army, worthy of praise with words,</xml>
<xml>provider of dwelling to his subjects, affluent, brilliant, and resembling</xml>
<xml>fire, grant us laudable riches.</xml>
<xml>37. O resplendent learned person, with powerful limbs, just as the</xml>
<xml>sharp fire creates the night, day, morning and evening, so shouldst thou</xml>
<xml>spread good instruction. Like fire burn the wicked with the force of</xml>
<xml>thy soul.</xml>
<xml>38. O man of power and supremacy, just as lovely Agni through</xml>
<xml>oblations brings us bliss, just as gift brings bliss, just as harmless dealing</xml>
<xml>brings bliss, just as our praises bring us bliss, so shouldst thou be blissful</xml>
<xml>unto us.</xml>
<xml>39. O man of power and supremacy behave in manner, where-</xml>
<xml>with we may get in battles, optimistic mind, praiseworthy followers, and</xml>
<xml>calm, determined soldiers.</xml>
<xml>40. O man of power and supremacy, with thy strength, grant us</xml>
<xml>daring courage in battles, add to the resources of our resolute army,</xml>
<xml>exerting to its utmost for victory. Acting in obedience to thy desires,</xml>
<xml>let us utilise the resources of the army.</xml>
<xml>41. O learned person, I value the omnipresent fire, led by which</xml>
<xml>the kine go to their home. The fleet-foot, steady and active steeds seek</xml>
<xml>the indestructible fire, as their home. I bring food to the learned who</xml>
<xml>sing thy glory. So shouldst thou realise that fire.</xml>
<xml>42. O learned person, I laud fire, that provides shelter ; whom the</xml>
<xml>speeches attain to. Just as the praiseworthy scholars walk slowly, and the</xml>
<xml>learned, famous for their knowledge, thoroughly imbibe learning for the</xml>
<xml>pupils who sing their praise, and just as the teacher explains the merits</xml>
<xml>of God and other objects, so shouldst thou acquire the knowledge of all</xml>
<xml>these things.</xml>
<xml>43. O beautiful, pleasurable teacher, just as two ladels of ghee</xml>
<xml>cook food, so fill in thy mouth both the practices of reading and teaching.</xml>
<xml>38-40. Man of power may mean the head of the army.</xml>
<xml>41. In the evening, in the light of the sun the kine go home,</xml>
<xml>43. The word ^nw in the text may also mean knowledge and action.</xml>
<xml>164 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>O lord of strepgth, teach us the vedic lore, and give food to us and the</xml>
<xml>learned.</xml>
<xml>44. O teacher, we derive today from thee like a disciplined horse,</xml>
<xml>the pleasant knowledge of the vedas. May we always make progress, hav-</xml>
<xml>ing received the knowledge which touches our soul, and is blissful like</xml>
<xml>intellect.</xml>
<xml>45. O learned person, just as thou art in the possession of convey-</xml>
<xml>ances for journey, having the intellectual wisdom of a truthful person,</xml>
<xml>following the noble path of virtue, filled with pleasurable physical and</xml>
<xml>spiritual strength, so shouldst we blissfully and certainly be.</xml>
<xml>46. O learned person, be thou well-disposed towards us, like a</xml>
<xml>king with his armies. With these worshipful learned persons be thou</xml>
<xml>for us the expositor of knowledge ; and the uplifter of the down-trodden,</xml>
<xml>granting us pleasure.</xml>
<xml>47. He, who with his superior knowledge, deserves harmlessness,</xml>
<xml>is fit to be honoured by the learned, is powerful in deeds, is imbued with</xml>
<xml>noble qualities, and displays diverse kinds of lustre, with extreme loveli-</xml>
<xml>ness, by performing Havan, using ghee and water, him do I honour. He</xml>
<xml>is the giver of happiness, the knower of all created objects, charitably</xml>
<xml>disposed like the son of a great man, giver of gifts, foremost amongst the</xml>
<xml>wise, and a trustworthy, highly learned person, brilliant like fire.</xml>
<xml>48. O learned person, be thou our nearest friend, our protector,</xml>
<xml>most prosperous, and blissful unto us, like fire that gives us riches, food-</xml>
<xml>grains, and wealth. O learned person, actuated by noble aspirations, just</xml>
<xml>as we pray unto thee with our friends for happiness, so may all pray. Just</xml>
<xml>as I goodly meet thee full of desirable intentions, so shouldst thou meet us.</xml>
<xml>49. With whatever penance, the sages, well-read in vedic lore,</xml>
<xml>securing illuminating pleasure, and full of true knowledge, explore fire ;</xml>
<xml>with similar devotion, for the acquisition of happiness, do I grasp the fire,</xml>
<xml>described by the thoughtful learned persons as pervader of the</xml>
<xml>atmosphere.</xml>
<xml>50. O learned persons, just as ye, mastering that fire, engaged in the</xml>
<xml>performance of virtuous vedic deeds, residing in a beautiful knowable,</xml>
<xml>44. Just as a well fed disciplined horse takes us fast to our destination, so a student</xml>
<xml>properly looked after and well taught soon becomes learned.</xml>
<xml>46. These : mentioned in the previous verses.</xml>
<xml>47. A leader should possess these qualities.</xml>
<xml>48. See Yajur 3-25, 26. Interpretation given there is different from that given here.</xml>
<xml>Fire: -Electricity.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XV 165</xml>
<xml>pleasant place, built scientifically, attain to happiness with your wives,</xml>
<xml>sons, brothers, other relatives, and with gold, so may we also be happy in</xml>
<xml>all these respects.</xml>
<xml>51. O learned person, full of knowledge, protector of the virtuous,</xml>
<xml>having understood the essence of vedic speech, cast under foot those who</xml>
<xml>would fight against him, who is well read, firmly established on the earth,</xml>
<xml>benefits all with his advice, and sticks to religion.</xml>
<xml>52. May this commander of the army, most manly, supporter of</xml>
<xml>the lives of all, powerful like thousand soldiers, shining with knowledge</xml>
<xml>and justice like sun in the midst of heaven, free from carelessness, shine,</xml>
<xml>and attain to nice birth, deeds and position.</xml>
<xml>53. O people, learn well all sciences, follow the path of the</xml>
<xml>virtuous, be religious-minded. O learned grandfather, in thy lifetime,</xml>
<xml>let thy sons, leading a life of Brahmcharya, in the bloom of their youth,</xml>
<xml>marry according to their own selection, and produce afterwards children,</xml>
<xml>according to the rules of eugenics.</xml>
<xml>54. O highly learned man or woman acquire knowledge thoroughly,</xml>
<xml>avoid ignorance, and be full of learning. Thou wife and this husband</xml>
<xml>both, in this present place and in future, should acquire desired happiness,</xml>
<xml>honour the learned, pray to God, keep good company, give true knowledge</xml>
<xml>as a free gift, possess full strength, cultivate Brahmcharya, acquire the</xml>
<xml>glory of knowledge, attain to puberty, and try for the attainment of final</xml>
<xml>beatitude through helpful means.</xml>
<xml>Let all the learned and the sacrificers be seated in this place.</xml>
<xml>55. O learned man or woman, just as thou, for the happiness of the</xml>
<xml>wise, with a resolute vow, solvest the thousand problems of domestic</xml>
<xml>life, and with knowledge observe st the injunction of the vedas, so help us</xml>
<xml>in discharging our domestic duties.</xml>
<xml>56. O learned man or woman, this is thy house comfortable in all</xml>
<xml>seasons. Stick fast to religion keeping in mind the education received,</xml>
<xml>whereby thou hast attained to name and fame. Cause then our riches to</xml>
<xml>increase.</xml>
<xml>57. O God, for my prosperity, the Magh (January-February) and</xml>
<xml>Phagan (February-March) these two months constituting the dewy-winter,</xml>
<xml>53. Rules of conception are given in the Sanskar Vidbi by Swami Dayananda, while</xml>
<xml>dealing with Garbhadan Sanskar.</xml>
<xml>54. In this present place : domestic life, Grihastha Ashrama.</xml>
<xml>In this place : In Yajnasbala for performing the yajna.</xml>
<xml>Puberty .full youth.</xml>
<xml>166 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>add to my pleasure. Thou pervadest them and fire. In those months let</xml>
<xml>sky and earth, and water be pleasure-giving. Let medicinal plants grow</xml>
<xml>in them. Let lightning-fires, following the same laws, be separately useful</xml>
<xml>to us. These lightning-fires residing in between the Sky and Earth,</xml>
<xml>unanimously the cause of Dewy-winter, create the Magh and Phagan</xml>
<xml>months. The learned should use these mighty fires. Just as the Sky and</xml>
<xml>Earth, through the dispensation of God work together like breath, so</xml>
<xml>should you wife and husband live constantly together.</xml>

<xml>who like sun's light are shining in humility and knowledge, who are</xml>
<xml>powerful like the rain. To them ten eastward, southward ten, ten to the</xml>
<xml>west, ten to the north, ten to the region uppermost. To them we offer</xml>

<xml>His grandeur, connects the earth and the sun, so shouldst thou associate</xml>
<xml>with all. Let the venerable rich learned person throw all our foes into</xml>
<xml>confusion.</xml>
<xml>16. Just as fire burns grass dry or wet, so we should burn all our vices and imbibe</xml>
<xml>virtues. Just as electricity pervades all objects, so should we learn all sciences and dispel</xml>
<xml>ignorance.</xml>
<xml>17. God was present in matter the cause of the universe, and is present in all heavenly</xml>
<xml>bodies, created therefrom.</xml>
<xml>20. Adorable cause is matter, from which results this universe, which is ephemeral</xml>
<xml>and is dissolved into atoms by God.</xml>
<xml>The process of creating the universe from indestructible matter by God, and dissolving</xml>
<xml>it again into atoms is eternal.</xml>

<xml>select him as thy minister for advice in state affairs, who is highly</xml>
<xml>serviceable, dignified, unworthy of harm, protector, and wealthy. Let</xml>
<xml>the good subjects bow unto him ; so that this minister be quick to hurt,</xml>
<xml>and fit to be respected in various ways.</xml>
<xml>25. Ye people, when you elect as your ruler the man, who is the</xml>
<xml>guardian of the lovers of justice ; has a patient mind peaceful through</xml>
<xml>austerity, grants us dainties, and makes the officials and the subjects</xml>
<xml>respect each other, and live together like the ancient far extended</xml>
<xml>Heaven and Earth, and make progress working unitedly like feet the</xml>
<xml>lowest protions of the body, then alone is the government stabilised.</xml>

<xml>matter, the source of creation ; to Whom all yogis attain. Who acts as</xml>
<xml>Lord over eternal soul and matter. Who is Self Existent. In Whom</xml>
<xml>abide all things existing.</xml>
<xml>31. O people ye do not know God, Who has produced those crea-</xml>
<xml>tures, Who is away from the irreligious and separate from soul and</xml>
<xml>matter, and being present in al! is still distant ; as ye are sunk in the</xml>
<xml>darkness of ignorance ; occupied with the discussion of partial truth and</xml>
<xml>untruth, engaged in the enjoyment of carnal pleasures, and abandoning</xml>
<xml>the practice of 3 7 oga, are busy with controversy over the meanings of</xml>
<xml>words.</xml>
<xml>32. Firstly was created the air, in which are performed all good</xml>
<xml>deeds ; secondly was created the sun, which sustains the earth ; thirdly</xml>
<xml>was created the cloud, that fosters plants, waters and souls, and helps the</xml>
<xml>retention of life in material objects, is the guardian of many, and begetter</xml>
<xml>of rain.</xml>

<xml>arms sharpened, fearless like a strong bull, a zealous killer of foes, strikes</xml>
<xml>terror in men ; makes the enemies weep bitterly, works day and night,</xml>
<xml>a sole hero, rends asunder the opponents, and subdues with us a hundred</xml>

<xml>their speed with the commander, who makes the enemies weep, is ever</xml>
<xml>exerting, is fond of victory, arranges his soldiers in different divisions,</xml>
<xml>puts the enemies to inconvenience, is steady, energetic, and strong, with</xml>

<xml>and begin the battle with him, who with his physical, mental and military</xml>
<xml>strength, cleaves the enemies' families, usurps their land, is armed with</xml>
<xml>weapons, slay's the foes, subdues the enemy in the battle, and conquers</xml>
<xml>him.</xml>
<xml>39. May the commander of the army, who, with surpassing vigour</xml>
<xml>pierces in the battles the families of the enemies, is pitiless, wild with</xml>
<xml>anger, unconquerable by foes, conqueror of the enemy's forces, unequalled</xml>
<xml>in fight, and victor, protect our armies,</xml>
<xml>40. In battle, the commander, the leader of these armies of the</xml>
<xml>learned, the conqueror and demolisher of the enemies should march behind.</xml>
<xml>The organiser of the army should march in front. The leader of</xml>
<xml>big bands should march on the right. The encourager of the army should</xml>
<xml>march on the left. The warriors swift like air should march ahead.</xml>
<xml>41. Musical instruments, to infuse valour and energy shouW be</xml>
<xml>played upon before the commencement of the battle, by the learned</xml>
<xml>soldiers of the powerful commander, and mighty king, who possess decent</xml>
<xml>homes, lofty ideas, are able to conquer the enemies, have led a life of</xml>
<xml>celibacy for forty eight years, are highly learned and strong, full of</xml>
<xml>terrible power.</xml>
<xml>42. O adorable commander the slayer of foes, like the sun of</xml>
<xml>clouds, make the weapons of our soldiers flourish, excite the spirits of</xml>
<xml>our warring heroes, increase the speed of our horses, and let the din of</xml>
<xml>conquering cars go upward.</xml>

<xml>44. O queen the slayer of foes, organise the bands of thjr army,</xml>
<xml>that bewilders the hearts of the forces of the enemy, remain aloof from</xml>
<xml>sin, convey thy aim to thy soldiers, burn down the foes, whereby they</xml>
<xml>may abide in utter darkness with hearts full of griefs.</xml>
<xml>45. O' wife of the comraander-in-chief, expert in the art of archery,</xml>
<xml>trained by a learned person knowing the vedas, on persuasion, go afar,</xml>
<xml>encounter the foes, achieve victory by slaying them. Let not even one of</xml>

<xml>46. Advance, O heroes, win the day. May the commander of the</xml>
<xml>army provide ye with shelter, food and clothes, Exceeding mighty be</xml>
<xml>your arms, that none may threaten or injure you.</xml>
<xml>47. O learned persons, the army of our enemies, that comes against</xml>
<xml>us in a jealous mood, with its might, meet ye and enwrap it harshly in</xml>
<xml>the darkness of the smoke arising out of the use of cannons so that they</xml>
<xml>may not recognise one another.</xml>
<xml>48. There where the flights of arrows fall like boys whose locks</xml>
<xml>are unshorn, may the Commander, the protector of the big army grant</xml>
<xml>us shelter, may the entire Assembly adorned with members, grant us a</xml>
<xml>happy home through all our days.</xml>
<xml>49. O valiant warrior, thy vital parts I cover with armour. May</xml>
<xml>this calm, considerate king protect thee with efficacious medicine. May</xml>
<xml>the exalted King give tbee what is more than ample. May the learned</xml>
<xml>encourage thee in thy triumph over the wicked.</xml>
<xml>44. JrtAcc rding to Sayana, a female deity who presides over in ; according to</xml>
<xml>Mahidhar, sickness or fear. According to Swami Dayananda, it means the queen who leads</xml>
<xml>the army of women and kills the foes. This verse advocates the formation of the army of</xml>
<xml>women.</xml>
<xml>47. Darkness . the use of fiery weapons produces smoke, that envelops the enemy's</xml>
<xml>forces, and being blinded one soldier cannot recognise the other. It may also refer to the</xml>
<xml>use of gases which darken the eyes of the soldiers.</xml>
<xml>48. Like boys : The arrows (all where they list, as boys before the Mundan Sanskar,</xml>
<xml>(tonsure ceremony) play about vigorously wherever they like.</xml>
<xml>Professor Roth separates Visikha from Kumara, and translates 'where the arrows fly,</xml>
<xml>young and old' ; that is feathered and unfeathered. Swami Dayananda translates arrows to</xml>
<xml>Bean weapons and arms.</xml>

<xml>the master of the vedas teach them.</xml>
<xml>53. O learned King, may all the intellectuals bear and lift thee</xml>
<xml>upward. May thou endowed with convincing knowledge, shining with</xml>
<xml>the light of mastery of various subjects, be propitious unto us.</xml>
<xml>54. Casting aside dense ignorance and evil genius, these educated</xml>
<xml>wives of the learned, engaged in different duties like the five regions,</xml>
<xml>for the growth of riches, serving their husbands should yearn for domestic</xml>
<xml>life, whereby this domestic life be made firm in the aquisition of wealth.</xml>
<xml>55. Just as the learned, in enkindled fire, perform Agnihotra</xml>
<xml>yajna, so should a highly revered person, the singer of vedic hymns,</xml>
<xml>adorable, lovable sacrificer perform the well lighted yajna, accepting it</xml>
<xml>with vigour.</xml>
<xml>56. Just as learned persons, desirous of performing yajna, engage</xml>
<xml>themselves in [the performance of Agni Hotra yajna for the happiness of</xml>
<xml>the learned, and just as for the loving, benign, and virtuous priest, % the</xml>
<xml>wealth of knowledge, and a sacrificer (Yajman) intent on acquiring</xml>
<xml>riches, and lord of a hundred drinkable objects like milk and itsilk, are</xml>
<xml>there, so should ye the imparters of knowledge, having acquired learning</xml>
<xml>perform the Agni Hotra yajna.</xml>
<xml>57. The householder, who with a tranquil mind, puts into the fire,</xml>
<xml>for performing the yajna, the oblation which moves above and removes</xml>
<xml>51. His share : The wealth obtained through defeating the enemy should not be</xml>
<xml>usurped by the King, but distributed amongst the warring soldiers.</xml>
<xml>52. The priests teach the King, and the King the Knower of the Vedas teaches them-</xml>
<xml>Knowledge is thus preserved and expanded through deliberations.</xml>
<xml>53. The text has occurred in 12-31, with a different interpretation.</xml>
<xml>56. Priest means Hota.</xml>
<xml>57. Fourth yajua .-Excellent yajna. In Shatapatha Brahmana 9-2-3-1 1 the Turiya</xml>
<xml>(fourth) yajna is described as one in which the Adhwaryu sings verges from the Yajur veda,</xml>
<xml>^nd then Hota recites hymns from the Rig Veda, and theu Brahma recites the Apratirath or</xml>
<xml>irresistible Sukta (R. V. 10-103), Professor Eggeling remarks that these verses (33-44) are</xml>
<xml>enigmatical, but his view is incorrect, as the verses are clear.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XVII 185</xml>
<xml>foul smell, performs the fourth yajna. May prayers and the fulfilment</xml>
<xml>of our desires bless us in the yajna where we get material fit for Homa.</xml>
<xml>58. Sun gives us light from the beginning of creation. Its rays</xml>
<xml>are green. In the created world it incessantly gives us strength. A</xml>
<xml>learned person perceiving fully realises its science. With its light, the</xml>
<xml>Earth, planets and stars, the protectors of the world, manifest all</xml>
<xml>regions.</xml>
<xml>59. This sun, in the midst of heaven, like an aeroplane, sits,</xml>
<xml>filling the earth, sky and air's mid region, with its light. It spreads its</xml>
<xml>beams that illumine the world and give us water. It sheds its lustre</xml>
<xml>on the day, the night and the intervening period.</xml>
<xml>60. God has set the sun in the midst of heaven. It attracts rain-</xml>
<xml>water and pours it down, is red, protects us thoroughly, possesses diverse</xml>
<xml>coloured rays,rotates, keeps under check the clouds and different worlds,</xml>
<xml>and guards them. It pervades lightning the efficient cause of light.</xml>
<xml>61. All vedic songs glorify God expansive like the space, the most</xml>
<xml>delightful of all pleasant objects, the Lord of the wise, the Guardian of</xml>

<xml>in truth and Relinqaisher from untruth, the Bestower of pleasures,</xml>
<xml>Worshipful, the giver of comfort and remover of discomforts. May the</xml>
<xml>Effulgent God grant and procure us noble qualities.</xml>
<xml>63. Just as God, the Sustainer, the Producer of Knowledge, through</xml>
<xml>devices of elevation lifts me up, so elect him as General of the army who</xml>
<xml>with his subjugating power keeps my foemen down.</xml>
<xml>64. May the learned increase wealth through strenuous e</xml>
<xml>and renunciation ; and may the military and civil heads of the</xml>
<xml>drive away my opposing foes.</xml>

<xml>ness through the science of electricity. Having procured the desired</xml>
<xml>happiness resulting from justice and humility, live in the company of tit</xml>
<xml>learned.</xml>

<xml>quadrupeds and bipeds.</xml>
<xml>67. Through yoga, from physical force I rise higher to mental</xml>
<xml>force ; from mental force I rise higher to spiritual force ; from spiritual</xml>
<xml>force I rise higher to God, the Blissful Light.</xml>
<xml>68. The learned yogis, who attain to Cod, the Sustainer of the</xml>
<xml>universe, on their march to salvation, pay no attention to worldly</xml>
<xml>pleasures, but rise to salvation, that frees them from birth and death.</xml>
<xml>69. Foremost of those who exert, O learned person, come forward,</xml>
<xml>thou art the eye of the literate and the illiterate.</xml>
<xml>The sacrificers, fain to worship, friendly to all, accordant with the</xml>
<xml>highly learned persons, attain to ordinary and extreme happiness.</xml>
<xml>70. Just as the nurse and mother with different characteristics,</xml>
<xml>but with one mind, working in harmony suckle the same child, so do the</xml>
<xml>night and dawn, with different hues nourish the world. Just as the</xml>
<xml>brilliant sun shines between the Heaven and Earth, so do the imparters</xml>
<xml>of knowledge imbibe the glow of knowledge.</xml>
<xml>71. O yogi, thou hast the knowledge of innumerable usages,</xml>
<xml>immense power of meditation, hundreds of accomplishments of life, and</xml>
<xml>thousands of modes of activity. Thou art the Lord of thousandfold</xml>
<xml>possessions. To thee full of knowledge may we offer our obeisance in</xml>
<xml>truthful words.</xml>
<xml>72. O learned yogi, with thy light, thou art endowed with</xml>
<xml>excellent noble qualities, yoked with high soul-power. Just as the</xml>
<xml>sun shines in the midst of heaven, so do thou be seated on earth. Grant</xml>
<xml>happiness to the people like air. As the sun fills air's mid-region with</xml>
<xml>its glow, so shouldst thou strengthen sovereignty with thy statesmanship.</xml>
<xml>Just as fire with its intense heat fills the quarters, so shouldst thou</xml>
<xml>elevate the people.</xml>
<xml>73. Thou, whose soul is enlightened with yoga, who invitest</xml>
<xml>respect from those who contact thee, the master of good traits, the</xml>
<xml>teacher of the science of yoga, through thy virtuous deeds, seat thyself</xml>
<xml>67. Antrikshaloka is described in the Shatapatha Brahmana as mind, vide Shatapatha</xml>
<xml>14/4/3/11. The verse may also mean, a yogi through yogic practices, can rise from the earth</xml>
<xml>to the space, from the space to the sun, from the sun ri t to the height of happiness.</xml>
<xml>69. Eye : who keeps a watch over their doings and shows them the right path.</xml>
<xml>70. See 12-2. The text is the same, but meanings are different.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XVII 187</xml>
<xml>firmly in God thy nearest home. Ye all yogis, with laudable acts, stick</xml>
<xml>fast to truth after discussion.</xml>
<xml>74. Just as a wise person, knows the exalted vedic speech of God,</xml>
<xml>the Adorable, the Giver of the glory of yoga, and enhances his knowledge</xml>
<xml>with that speech, that is wondrous, explains the creation of the universe,</xml>
<xml>is full of knowledge, explains each topic lucidly and gives us wisdom and</xml>
<xml>food, so do I rightly accept it.</xml>
<xml>75. O Yogi, we adore thee with praise-songs for thy past life, and</xml>
<xml>for thy present life, in which we live with thee. May we worship God</xml>
<xml>through whose shelter thou hast risen. Just as the performers of Homa,</xml>
<xml>put oblations in the well kindled fire, so do we remove our moral</xml>
<xml>weaknesses through the fire of yoga.</xml>
<xml>76. O most youthful yogi, first enkindled with dignity, with</xml>
<xml>continuous supremacy, long for us. Constantly unto thee come the</xml>
<xml>learned.</xml>
<xml>77. O learned person, just as a horse is fed with fodder, and</xml>
<xml>intellect sharpened with prayers, so art thou beneficent and pleasing to</xml>
<xml>our heart ; may we approach thee with praises, and advance under thy</xml>
<xml>protections.</xml>
<xml>78. Just as an oblation is put with butter, into the fire, filled</xml>
<xml>with fuel, so with a contemplative mind do I acquire discernment so that</xml>
<xml>the learned, who strengthen truth, and are devoted to knowledge, may</xml>
<xml>come here. To God, Lord of the Earth, and Master of all deeds, I</xml>
<xml>offer-up day after day the inviolable sacrifice of knowledge.</xml>
<xml>79. O sage, seven breaths are thy fuel, seven flames are thy flames</xml>
<xml>of knowledge, seven organs of perception are thy sources of wisdom.</xml>
<xml>74- It refers to vedic speech.</xml>
<xml>76. Most youthful : most advanced in knowledge.</xml>
<xml>77. See 15-44. The text is the same, but interpretation different. Protections means</xml>
<xml>qualities of protection.</xml>
<xml>79. STFft tf fTfoiZ: 5To 9-2-3-44.</xml>
<xml>Seven breaths : Pran, Apan, Saman Vyan, Udan, Devdutt, Dhananjaya.</xml>
<xml>Seven flames : Kali, Karali, Manojava, Sulohita, Sudhutnravarna, Sphulingini,</xml>
<xml>Vishvarupi. These have been spoken as seven tongues in the text.</xml>
<xml>Seven organs : Nose, tongue, eye, ear, skin, mind, intellect. These are called seven</xml>

<xml>188 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>Thou hast seven beloved mansions. Seven priests in sevenfold manner</xml>
<xml>pay thee worship. With knowledge and fine speech fill full these seven</xml>
<xml>sources of learning.</xml>
<xml>80. God is Purely Bright, Wonderfully Bright, Eternally Bright,</xml>
<xml>All Luminous, Bright, Truth's Protector, and free from Sin.</xml>
<xml>81. Persons, who are excellent like God, noble like other good</xml>
<xml>people, equal towards all, affectionate towards all, respectable, well-</xml>
<xml>balanced, and possessors ot worldly objects, succeed in life.</xml>
<xml>82. God is the Knower of truth, Most Excellent amongst the</xml>
<xml>excellent, Resolute, the Support of all, the Sustainer, the Owner of all</xml>
<xml>owners, and efficient Administrator.</xml>
<xml>83. He, who is the advancer of knowledge, elevator of religion,</xml>
<xml>Conqueror of armies, lord of goodly forces, keeper of friends near at hand ;</xml>
<xml>driver afar of foes, is worthy of estimation.</xml>
<xml>84. O learned persons, the performers of seasonwise sacrifice</xml>
<xml>(Yajna), well-qualified, resembling the aforesaid sacrificers, free from</xml>
<xml>partiality, similar in nature to the highly learned, truthful and religious,</xml>
<xml>come near unto us.</xml>
<xml>May the knowers of reality, discriminators of truth from untruth</xml>
<xml>like a balance, the supporters and nourishers of their companions protect</xml>
<xml>us to-day in this sacrifice.</xml>
<xml>85. He who exalts his men, feasts on dainty dishes, torments the</xml>
<xml>foes, is an admirable householder, lover of games, and mighty, becomes a</xml>
<xml>nice conqueror.</xml>
<xml>86. O King behave so that thy learned subjects, regular performers</xml>
<xml>of yajna, may become thy followers. Just as learned people, dear as</xml>
<xml>breath, follow God, so should the literate and the illiterate persons follow</xml>
<xml>this King, tfee giver of happiness through knowledge and teaching.</xml>
<xml>87. O man resplendent like fire, drink as from a teat filled with</xml>
<xml>milk, this invigorating juice of waters. In the midst of many welcome</xml>
<xml>this well full of sweet water. Fast like a horse, enter thy oceanic</xml>
<xml>dwellings,</xml>
<xml>88. O sailor, wish thou to master water. Ghee is the home of fire.</xml>
<xml>It rests in ghee. Ghee is its proper province. Utilise that fire for</xml>
<xml>88. This text has al c o a spiritual meaning as follow* :</xml>
<xml>O learned person, drink deep from the Vedas, God's teats, full of significant, forceful</xml>
<xml>words enjoy sweet, progressive devotion, and through contemplation, reach the spiritual home</xml>
<xml>gt knowledge.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XVII 189</xml>
<xml>producing food-stuffs. O giver of pleasures ; thou receivest the oblation</xml>
<xml>consecrated through vedic incantations, hence gladden us.</xml>
<xml>89. O men, know that forth from the ocean springs the watery</xml>
<xml>wave of sweetness with rays of the fun. Being divine it is extremely</xml>
<xml>pleasant in taste. The real cause of water is hidden. Salvation is the</xml>
<xml>result of the teachings of the learned.</xml>
<xml>90. He. whose knowledge of the four vedas is like four horns, who</xml>
<xml>studies and enjoys the vedas, is perfectly well versed in them all,</xml>
<xml>preaches them to humanity, and listens to their teachings from others, is</xml>
<xml>the praiseworthy embodiment of knowledge. It is our duty to propagate</xml>
<xml>it to others, and act upon it in our domestic life with words of veneration.</xml>
<xml>91. This yajna has got four horns, three feet, two heads, and seven</xml>
<xml>hands. This mighty, attainable yajna, the giver of happiness, bound with</xml>
<xml>a triple bond, roars loudly and enters into mortals.</xml>
<xml>89. The real cause : Primordial matter the real cause of water is hidden, mysterious</xml>
<xml>and unmani fened.</xml>
<xml>Professor Ludwig is unnecessarily furious over the explanations which Sayana gives.</xml>
<xml>The sense of the text is not obscure as alleged by him.</xml>
<xml>90. Professor Wilson following Sayana wrongly interprets the epithet 'four horned* as,</xml>
<xml>applying to God, who may be called a buffalo as a type of extraordinary strength. Mahidhar's</xml>
<xml>interpretation of four horns as four officiating priests is also wide the mark. 'Four horns' is a</xml>
<xml>phrase u^eH figuratively to denote the knowledge of the four vedas by a learned person.</xml>
<xml>Horns are pillars of spiritual knowledge.</xml>
<xml>91. Four horns : The four vedas.</xml>
<xml>Three feet : Mo-ning, noon, and evening.</xml>
<xml>Two heads : The rising and setting times of the sun.</xml>
<xml>Seven hands : The seven metres of the veda like Gayatri etc.</xml>
<xml>Triple bond : The Mantra, Kalpa and Brahmana, prayer, ceremonial, and rationale of</xml>
<xml>the veda, or the three regions, Heaven, Firmament, and Earth.</xml>
<xml>Loud roaring is the sound of the recitation of the vedic verses.</xml>
<xml>Different explanations have been given by Mahidhar for these words.</xml>
<xml>Patanjali in his immortal work the Mahabhashya explains these words differently.</xml>
<xml>The ver c e can be applied to grammar ( 3lt*$r.&)</xml>
<xml>Four horns are 1W (Noun) 3H$41<t (verb), 3*flRif (a preposition prefixed to roots) and</xml>
<xml>(Indeclinable).</xml>
<xml>Three feet : Past, present, and future.</xml>
<xml>Two heads . Nitya and pnf (Effect).</xml>
<xml>Seven hands : Seven cases.</xml>
<xml>Triple bonds :-~ Heart, Throat and Head.</xml>
<xml>190 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>92. The learned, masters of the worldly affairs, acquire after</xml>
<xml>research the knowledge bidden in the vedas, and laid three-wise.</xml>
<xml>Electricity exposes a part of that knowledge, sun another part, and the</xml>
<xml>learned the third part by their wisdom and experience.</xml>
<xml>93. These vedic speeches which flow from the inmost reservoir of</xml>
<xml>the heart are incontrovertible by the thievish foe. I realise these</xml>
<xml>speeches full of knowledge and see in their midst the Resplendent,</xml>
<xml>Beautiful God.</xml>
<xml>94. From the inmost recesses of the heart, purified by mind, flow</xml>
<xml>together our speeches as streams flow to the ocean. These waves of</xml>
<xml>knowledge pour swiftly like the deer running through the fear of a tiger.</xml>
<xml>95. Just as rushing down the rapids of a river, fall swifter than the</xml>
<xml>wind the vigorous currents, just as the swift fleeting horse, breaking</xml>
<xml>aside the battlefields, falls upon the enemy, watering the earth with</xml>
<xml>perspiration arising out of his endeavour to kill the foe, so do the exalted</xml>
<xml>speeches full of knowledge fall on the audience from the mouth of a</xml>
<xml>preacher.</xml>
<xml>96. Just as women of high character, of one mind, gently smiling,</xml>
<xml>incline towards their husbands, so do the speeches of pure knowledge,</xml>
<xml>glowing with apt use, meaning, and relation of words, reach a learned</xml>
<xml>person, who enjoying them attains to brilliance.</xml>
<xml>97. As maidens deck themselves with gay adornments and exhibit</xml>
<xml>their beauty to join thair husbands, so, where prosperity reigns, where</xml>
<xml>yajna is performed, there the intellectual speeches are sanctified on all</xml>
<xml>sides, which I enjoy again and again.</xml>
<xml>98. O married couple, welcome the laudable struggle for existence,</xml>
<xml>procure the wisdom of speech, milk, curd and butter. May the learned</xml>
<xml>bestow on us excellent possessions, and grant us this domestic life. The</xml>
<xml>learned receive the instructive, sjveet words of knowledge,</xml>
<xml>99. O God, this whole universe depends upon thy power and might</xml>
<xml>vast like the atmosphere. May we realise Thee.</xml>
<xml>O king may we acquire the strength that lies in thy breaths, thy</xml>
<xml>heart, thy lively soldiers and thy battlefield, and thy wisdom full of</xml>
<xml>admirable characteristics.</xml>
<xml>92. Laid threewise : placed in the earth 'atmosphere and heaven, contemplation</xml>
<xml>(Upasana) or in the form of k row ledge (Jnar) aod Action (Karma).</xml>
<xml>96. One mind : Husband and wife should be of one agreeable mind, attached to each</xml>
<xml>other.</xml>
<xml>97. I : a learned person.</xml>

<xml>the naked is the symbol of a great warrior. The offer of medicinal elixir is</xml>
<xml>the sign of honouring the guests.</xml>
<xml>15. O women, just as the juice of Soma medicine accepted by t</xml>

<xml>Abnegation.</xml>
<xml>Niyamas:- Cleanliness, Contentment, Austerity, Study, Truth in God,</xml>
<xml>11 I become free : To maintain the family link, it is necessary to produce a son. If</xml>
<xml>a householder is blessed with a son, he has discharged his debt towards his parents, by main-</xml>
<xml>taining the succession of his family. To die without a son is to die without discharging the</xml>
<xml>parental debt.</xml>
<xml>12. The lessons taught by the physicians in the science of healing are a kind of yajna</xml>
<xml>performed by them, for the betterment of the people.</xml>

<xml>206 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>learned lady is pleasant, as physicians and surgeons prepare the extracts of</xml>
<xml>medicines, as an aspirant after prosperity masters the science of lightning,</xml>
<xml>so should ye.</xml>
<xml>16. O people, for the successful performance of a yajna make</xml>
<xml>arrangement for these objects. Its nice execution, a seat for the king, a</xml>
<xml>jar for corns in the altar, a pitcher for Soma, food that gives life placed in</xml>
<xml>the northern altar, the priests and the physician.</xml>
<xml>17. O people, just as the learned persons decorate the altar with</xml>
<xml>materials for the yajna, obtain mighty riches through ceaseless effort, reap</xml>
<xml>through the process of union and separation, the result of their effort at</xml>
<xml>unity, produce well ordered light out of electricity, so should ye procure</xml>
<xml>all kinds of happiness by properly using all resources.</xml>
<xml>18. O householders, just as a learned man and woman collect</xml>
<xml>materials for the yajna ; a learned lady takes shelter with the priest, and</xml>
<xml>the learned construct a house for the majestic husband to dwell in and</xml>
<xml>impart happiness ; this all is a householder's duty ; which ye also should</xml>
<xml>perform.</xml>
<xml>19. He gets happiness, who has got servants to obey orders, maid-</xml>
<xml>servants of pleasing manners, who perform their duty gracefully, necessary</xml>
<xml>materials for the performance of yajna, and oblations to be put into the</xml>
<xml>fire by sacrificial practices.</xml>
<xml>20. A householder gains cows from cows, sacrificial materials from</xml>
<xml>ground rice-cakes, fire-kindling fuel from the knowledge of metres like</xml>
<xml>Gayatri etc., and virtuous people from sacrificial practices.</xml>
<xml>21. Roasted grains, gruel barley-meal, grains of roasted rice, milk,</xml>
<xml>and curd, mingled milk, nice corns, and honey are the materials for Soma</xml>
<xml>yajna.</xml>
<xml>22. Jujube fruit is the type of parched corn. Wheat is the best</xml>
<xml>product of agriculture. Jujube is the type of barley-meal. Barley is the</xml>
<xml>type of gruel-groats.</xml>
<xml>23. Barley-grains are the symbol of milk. Ripe jujube fruits are</xml>
<xml>the symbol of curd. The essence of corn is the symbol of Soma. The</xml>
<xml>17. For the sake of unity or peace, sometimes separation or partition is a necessity.</xml>
<xml>20. Fuel is burnt and put in the altar with the recitation of verses in Gayatri metre.</xml>
<xml>21. Mingled milk : a mixture of boiled milk, curd and sugar.</xml>
<xml>22. Just as jujube fruit (It) is easily eaten by the goats, so parched corns (fffcft) *re eaten</xml>
<xml>conveniently.</xml>
<xml>Barley-meal (W$).</xml>
<xml>Up vakas: seeds of the Wrightia Aatidysenterica.</xml>

<xml>Just is curd produces semen so do jujube fruits produce streof th.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XIX 207</xml>
<xml>juices of So ma plants are like the mixture of milk and curd.</xml>
<xml>24. The students who are seekers after knowledge, should request</xml>
<xml>the preceptor to instruct them in all branches of knowledge. The know-</xml>
<xml>ledge imparted to the pupils should be in consonance with their capacity,</xml>
<xml>'Pray grant 7 is the sign of receiving and assimilating knowledge. We, the</xml>
<xml>performers of sacrifice are fit to sing praises.</xml>
<xml>25* A learned person gets songs of praise by verse-halves, short</xml>
<xml>detached formulae by case-terminations. By Om exclamations he gets</xml>
<xml>the mode of praise, prayer and contemplation. By water is got the soma</xml>
<xml>juice.</xml>
<xml>26. They are the benefactors of humanity who perform the morn-</xml>
<xml>ing yajna with the sun and moon, the glorious mid-day prosperity</xml>
<xml>bringer yajna through lightning, the evening yajna, the giver of health,</xml>
<xml>through true vedic speech, for reverence of the learned.</xml>
<xml>27. He is wealthy, who with the attributes of air gains the objects</xml>
<xml>residing in air, by the process of separation gains the Drona and Kalash,</xml>
<xml>vessels for Soma, by two jars of corn and water gains two cleansing vessels,</xml>
<xml>and by the cooking pot gains the pots for cooking.</xml>
<xml>28. The recitation of the Yajur Veda gives us the knowledge of</xml>
<xml>ceremonies (Sanskaras). The knowledge of ceremonies (Karma-Kanda)</xml>
<xml>teaches us the attributes of objects and different praise-songs. Through</xml>
<xml>Gayatri metres, and learned singers of the praise of fine traits are obtain-</xml>
<xml>ed the vedic verses worthy of recitation and weapons. The recitation of</xml>
<xml>Sama veda gives us purification.</xml>
<xml>29. A learned person obtains eatable foodstuffs from parts of the</xml>
<xml>earth, and fulfils desires by the utterance of true noble words. From a</xml>
<xml>peaceful deed is derived good relation between husband and wife.</xml>
<xml>Consummation is obtained by performing the ceremonies (Karma-kanda)</xml>
<xml>of the Yajur Veda.</xml>
<xml>30. By the vow of celibacy one gains consecration, by consecration</xml>
<xml>one gains wealth and position. By wealth and position one gains faith,</xml>
<xml>by*faith comes the knowledge of truth.</xml>
<xml>23. By water 'Water is mixed with the Soma plant to extract its juice. Milk can also</xml>
<xml>be used for the same purpose.</xml>
<xml>26. Lightning means the heat of the sun at midday.</xml>
<xml>27. Two cleansing vessels : itfFjs and anET^Fffel. In the latter the Soma is shaken, and</xml>
<xml>the former receives the purified juice.</xml>
<xml>One who understands the science of air knows the science of measurement, and there-</xml>
<xml>by the science of cooking, which purifies food stuffs.</xml>
<xml>28. Avbrith The expiatory bath of purification*</xml>
<xml>30. Consecration ; Devotion to a tacred use.</xml>
<xml>308 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>31. He commences his second birth, who wearing the yajnopavit,</xml>
<xml>joins a well arranged yajna, the nature of which has been explained by the</xml>
<xml>learned, the vedas and God.</xml>
<xml>32. The exalted adorable sacrifices, equipped with food-stuffs,</xml>
<xml>make prosperous with oblations the yajna, great like the sun in the sky,</xml>
<xml>full of Soma juice, giver of heroes, the masters of physical and spiritual</xml>
<xml>forces. May we be happy, doing noble deeds, befriending the dignified</xml>
<xml>and learned persons, and gaining power.</xml>
<xml>33. O learned person, the strong essence of Soma, duly collected</xml>
<xml>by a charitable lady is drawn from plants. With that glanddening</xml>
<xml>essence impel with joy, the sacrificer, the learned lady, the scholarly</xml>
<xml>teachers and preachers, the supreme king and Commander, and the hero</xml>
<xml>that burns the foe like fire.</xml>
<xml>34. In this world, for wealth and physical strength, I drink and</xml>
<xml>feed on Soma plant, producer of activity, brilliant, giver of glory, full of</xml>
<xml>sweetness, highly invigorating, acquired by a learned lady and the King</xml>
<xml>and Commander from clouds that do not release water.</xml>
<xml>35. Whatever portion of this savoury fluid is clinging here, what</xml>
<xml>the sun drank with his powers of attraction, I drink and feed on that</xml>
<xml>brilliant Soma juice, with a pure mind.</xml>
<xml>36. We offer food and homage to our fathers who desire food and</xml>
<xml>water. We offer food and homage to our grandfathers, who desire food</xml>
<xml>and water. We offer food and homage to our great-grandfathers, who</xml>
<xml>desire food and water. O parents eat the food we have prepared. O</xml>
<xml>parents and teachers rejoice and make us full of joy. O preachers be</xml>
<xml>satisfied and satisfy us. O learned persons be purified and purify us.</xml>
<xml>37. May fathers, full of glory and mental peace, purify me with a</xml>
<xml>pure life of a hundred years. May grandfathers, purify me with a pure</xml>
<xml>life of a hundred years. May great grandfathers purify me with a pure</xml>
<xml>life of a hundred years. May learned and calm grandfathers purify me</xml>
<xml>with a happy, pure life of a hundred years. May sedate great-grandfathers</xml>
<xml>purify me with a pure life of a hundred years. May I obtain full length</xml>
<xml>of life.</xml>
<xml>38. O learned parents, ye purify the age-prolonging foodgrains,</xml>
<xml>send down upon us food and vigorous strength. Drive ye far away from</xml>
<xml>us the company of evil persons.</xml>
<xml>33. According to Swami Deyananda there are twenty four kinds of Soma plants.</xml>
<xml>35 f Here means on the earth. A part has been drunk by the sun.</xml>
<xml>CHAMEft 3C1X</xml>
<xml>39. O learned amongst the born, just as the wise purify me with</xml>
<xml>knowledge and love, and purify our intellect, just as all material things</xml>
<xml>purify me, so shouldst thou purify me.</xml>
<xml>40. O refulgent learned person, imparter of knowledge, first purify</xml>
<xml>thyself with noble spiritual force, and then purify me. Purifying</xml>
<xml>thyself with intellect and acts purify my intellect and acts again and</xml>
<xml>again.</xml>
<xml>41. O God purify me with Thy pure vedic knowledge diffused by</xml>
<xml>Thy pure lustrous nature.</xml>
<xml>42. God, Who in our midst, by His immaculate nature, is Pure and</xml>
<xml>Giver of different sciences, is ever our Purifier and Preacher. My He,</xml>
<xml>the Cleanser, make me clean.</xml>
<xml>43. O God, the Giver of happiness, Impeller for virtuous deedi,</xml>
<xml>with true behaviour, full glory, knowledge and exertion, purify me on</xml>
<xml>every side.</xml>
<xml>44. Vedic speech, the benefactor of humanity and the repository</xml>
<xml>of knowledge comes unto us and purifies us.</xml>
<xml>Through her may we in sacrificial banquets taking our pleasure be</xml>
<xml>the lords of riches.</xml>
<xml>45. The officials, who in the realm of a just king, are equal in</xml>
<xml>status and knowledge, have their dwelling place, food, reverence and</xml>
<xml>sense of fairness approved by the learned.</xml>
<xml>46. My folk yet living among those who live, are of one mind and</xml>
<xml>similar attributes. On me be set their wealth through a hundred years</xml>
<xml>in this world.</xml>
<xml>47. I have heard mention of two pathways of birth and death, the</xml>
<xml>ways of parents, the learned and the mortals. On these two roads each</xml>
<xml>moving creature travels. Each soul leaves the present parents and assumes</xml>
<xml>new ones.</xml>
<xml>48. May my fiery husband make my progeny abundant. May this</xml>
<xml>my married life bring me ten brave children, all good objects, physical</xml>
<xml>strength, good progeny, cattle, spiritual force and fearlessness, for my</xml>
<xml>welfare. O parents do ye confer on us food, milk, and manly vigour.</xml>
<xml>49. May our parents, who do not steal, know the truth, gain strength</xml>
<xml>of battles, through control of breath, protect us well. May the lowest,</xml>
<xml>highest, midmost elders calm and peaceful in nature, urge us on to battle.</xml>
<xml>50. Our elders are masters of different principles of knowledge,</xml>
<xml>preachers of new expositions on problems of learning, devotees of non-</xml>
<xml>violence, highly learned, and deserving of supremacy.</xml>
<xml>210 Y.AJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>May we follow the sound advice of these adorable elders, and enjoy</xml>
<xml>their gracious loving-kindness.</xml>
<xml>51. Our aged learned parents, tranquil in mind, highly rich, come</xml>
<xml>again and again to our Soma banquet.</xml>
<xml>Let just and self-controlled son, desiring for nice food, giver of</xml>
<xml>pleasure, fulfil all his desires, with the aid of our parents desirous of our</xml>
<xml>protection.</xml>
<xml>52. O sedate learned fellow, thou art pre-eminent for wisdom. With</xml>
<xml>thy wisdom, thou followest the straightest path of happiness. Make me</xml>
<xml>also follow the same path. O learned fellow happy like the moon, the wise</xml>
<xml>parents, with thy excellent guidance, make us enjoy riches amongst the</xml>
<xml>learned.</xml>
<xml>53. O virtuous, glorious progeny, the religious deeds which our</xml>
<xml>aged, wise and learned persons perform with thee, so shouldst we.</xml>
<xml>O non-violent, religious child remove our enemy from all sides with</xml>
<xml>brave horsemen and bestow riches on us.</xml>
<xml>54. O moon-like gladdening noble son, taking vow with thy learned</xml>
<xml>fatherly teachers, spread pleasure, leading a religious life between the</xml>
<xml>Earth and Heaven.</xml>
<xml>O beautiful son, may we offer thee gifts for thy pleasure, and may we</xml>
<xml>become the lords of riches.</xml>
<xml>55. O justice loving fathers, who sit in an exalted assembly, come,</xml>
<xml>help us. Accept these eatables we have prepared for ye.</xml>
<xml>Come to us with most auspicious favour, grant us happiness and</xml>
<xml>purity of character, and keep miseries away from us.</xml>
<xml>56. I know the elders, who impart sound knowledge. I know the</xml>
<xml>eternal strength of God and His creation of the universe. May those visit</xml>
<xml>our homes, who solely devoted to God, with their soul-force, and self-</xml>
<xml>realisation, worship the Blissful Creator.</xml>
<xml>57. May they, the Fathers, worthy of homage, invited to their</xml>
<xml>excellent, favourite wealth of oblations, come nigh unto us, listen to ui,</xml>
<xml>preach unto us, and afford us protection.</xml>
<xml>56. Prof. Ludwig and Prof. Gras-n&an have not grasped the significance of the verse.</xml>
<xml>Prof. Ludwig says Vikramanam is an unintelligible expression. Napatam has been translated</xml>
<xml>as fire. Mahidhara takes Vishnu to mean 'of the sacrifice', and napatam and Vikramanam at</xml>
<xml>the two paths leading to the Gods and to the Fathers. Maharshi Dayananda interprets Vishnu</xml>
<xml>'of Cod 1 . Napatam as Eternal, Indestructible, Vikraranam as diverse creation of the universe.</xml>
<xml>The verse is quite intelligible.</xml>
<xml>57. Fathers j The learned people.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XIX 211</xml>
<xml>58. May they our fathers, having knowledge of the science of fire</xml>
<xml>possessing mental peace, calmness and self-restraint come on Godward</xml>
<xml>pathways, enjoying at this sacrifice their meals, may they teach and</xml>
<xml>instruct us, and afford us protection.</xml>
<xml>59. May the learned persons, who know the science of fire and</xml>
<xml>material objects, are well-versed in politics, come now for the spread of</xml>
<xml>knowledge, visiting house to house, and staying there, eat the meals</xml>
<xml>prepared carefully. Hence, being engaged in the noble work of spreading</xml>
<xml>education, may they grant us riches with brave sons.</xml>
<xml>60. For those who know the science of fire, and are well-versed in</xml>
<xml>sciences other than fire, and enjoy in the midst of knowledge with their</xml>
<xml>own strength, may the Self Effulgent God. make long-lived this body</xml>
<xml>endowed with vital breaths.</xml>
<xml>61. We invite for the good of humanity, the sages who know the</xml>
<xml>science of fire, drink the medicinal juice of Soma, and are true to seasons.</xml>
<xml>May they be charitable to us, and make us lords of wealth.</xml>
<xml>62. O ye all learned people, injure us not for any sin which w</xml>
<xml>through human frailty have committed.</xml>
<xml>Bowing with the bent knees and seated on the right we pay ye</xml>
<xml>homage. Pray accept our respectful conduct.</xml>
<xml>63. Ye fathers grant riches to the charitably disposed persons and</xml>
<xml>your sons sitting near their fascinating mothers.</xml>
<xml>Always give them a portion of your treasure, so that they may there-</xml>
<xml>by gain energy.</xml>
<xml>64. O learned person, brilliant like fire and bestower of nice</xml>
<xml>objects on the wise, grant us the supremacy which thou through praise-</xml>
<xml>worthy eloquence considerest fit to be granted to the learned.</xml>
<xml>65. He, who persuades the learned to noble deeds, is resplendent</xml>
<xml>like fire with the light of knowledge, and reveres the sages advanced in</xml>
<xml>vedic lore, is fully fit to preach to the wise and the elders, the agreeable</xml>
<xml>branches of knowledge.</xml>
<xml>58. Fathers : The teachers, the preachers and learned parents. Agnishwata has been</xml>
<xml>translated by Mahidhara and Griffith as parents consumed by fire after death ; whereas</xml>
<xml>Rishi Dayananda interprets the word to refer to living persons who know full well the science</xml>
<xml>of fire. The orthodox people generally quote this verse in support of Shradha certmony of tht</xml>
<xml>dead, which is not corroborated by th* text.</xml>
<xml>6& They : mothers and thoir children.</xml>
<xml>212 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>66. O son, possessing the eloquence of the learned, pure like fire,</xml>
<xml>praiseworthy, thou preparest fragrant meals. Offer them to the elders.</xml>
<xml>Let them take them as food. O learned donor, eat thou the food prepared</xml>
<xml>with effort.</xml>
<xml>67. O sharp witted scholar, thou knowest well the number of</xml>
<xml>fathers who are here and who are absent, whom we know and whom we</xml>
<xml>know not. Thou knowest a large number of them and they know thee.</xml>
<xml>Serve them with food and meritorious reverence.</xml>
<xml>68. Now let us offer food to the fathers who are more advanced than</xml>
<xml>us in age and knowledge, who have taken to Banprastha and Sanyas</xml>
<xml>Ashramas, who are engrossed in worldly affairs, and who work amongst the</xml>
<xml>people of high character.</xml>
<xml>69. O learned person, just as our noble, ancient elders, givers of</xml>
<xml>sound instructions, pure, devotees of truth, spreading knowledge, acquire</xml>
<xml>well-behaved wives and ground to dwell upon, remove ignorance, and</xml>
<xml>cast away the coverings of darkness, so shouldst thou serve them.</xml>
<xml>70. Right gladly do we make thee the store-house of knowledge.</xml>
<xml>Right gladly do we educate thee. Gladly bring yearning fathers nigh to</xml>
<xml>eat food.</xml>
<xml>71. O Commander of the army, just as the sun wrenches off the</xml>
<xml>head of the cloud full of water but unwilling to release it, so do thou</xml>
<xml>advance thy armies, and subdue all contending hosts.</xml>
<xml>72. A renowned sage, through yoga, and religious practices, over-</xml>
<xml>comes death and attains to salvation. Just as with food one gets strength,</xml>
<xml>so he reaches the final beatitude on the strength of truth, realises his</xml>
<xml>soul-force, manifests the supreme nature of his supreme soul, pure like</xml>
<xml>milk, immortal like the Supreme Spirit, and sweet like honey.</xml>
<xml>73. Just as swan -separates milk from water and drinks it, so a</xml>
<xml>learned person, the embodiment of action, through yogic practices,</xml>
<xml>strengthening his soul with pure food, acquires divine hearing, sweetness,</xml>
<xml>healing medicine, pure love, and immaculate divine speech mingled with</xml>
<xml>the eternal connection between word and its significance in all worldly</xml>
<xml>objects.</xml>
<xml>67. Here : In the yajna.</xml>
<xml>Fathers : Elderly relatives, and aged learned person*.</xml>
<xml>70. Thee: disciple or son.</xml>
<xml>We : Teachers or fathers.</xml>
<xml>71. The word Namuchi is explained by Prof. Lamnan as a waterspout in a lake.</xml>
<xml>Risbi Dayanada has rightly interpreted it as a cloud that does not release water.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XIX 213</xml>
<xml>74. He 1vho enjoys the company of pure learned persons, is a dis-</xml>
<xml>criminator, willingly drinks Soma juice out of waters, purifies food with</xml>
<xml>vedic knowledge, is a cleanser of soul, equipped with the power of protec-</xml>
<xml>tion, knows God, is procurer of supremacy through the knowledge of yoga,</xml>
<xml>acquires happiness of soul sweet like honey, salvation, and the apparent</xml>
<xml>essence of knowledge.</xml>
<xml>75. A king, who along with one knowing all the four vedas, enjoys</xml>
<xml>his birth in a royal family and the milkwise invigorating essence of a</xml>
<xml>well-cooked food, and with justice coupled with learning and decorum,</xml>
<xml>administers his rule, the giver of glory, a gift from God, pre-eminent in all</xml>
<xml>dealings, the remover of the darkness of injustice, the bestower of valour,</xml>
<xml>and the source of diverse kinds of protection, always derives happiness</xml>
<xml>from this his administration fit for er joyment, inbued with justice, sweet-</xml>
<xml>ness, and delightfulness.</xml>
<xml>76. The generative organ releases urine, but when it enters the</xml>
<xml>womb, it releases semen. The caul-invested embryo leaves by its birth</xml>
<xml>the covering folds. The child, by the removal of covering folds, in their</xml>
<xml>contact with external air, acquires the wealth of soul, pure, excellent</xml>
<xml>and enjoyable ; and is endowed with these eyes, sweet like juice, and</xml>
<xml>source of everlasting knowledge.</xml>
<xml>77. God through His pure knowledge, viewing both forms hai</xml>
<xml>explained truth and falsehood. He has assigned the lack of faith to false-</xml>
<xml>hood, and faith to truth. He alone is worthy of worship by all, who is</xml>
<xml>the Abolisher of irreligiousness, Purifier, Sustainer, Truth personified.</xml>
<xml>Path-indicator of mind, Revealer of manly vedic truth, Giver of salvation,</xml>
<xml>Adorable, and source of knowledge.</xml>
<xml>78. The soul, full of real knowledge, with the help of all the four</xml>
<xml>vedas, realises the essence of Truth and Untruth. It acquires for itself</xml>
<xml>foodstuffs as meals, riches, the givers of valour and righteous character,</xml>
<xml>water, milk, imperishable, knowledge, sweet delicious articles, and the</xml>
<xml>knowledge bestowed by God.</xml>
<xml>79. The king, who is easily accessible to all, and in a just manner,</xml>
<xml>having carefully examined the juice of efficacious medicines, with pure</xml>
<xml>intention, drinks the delight-giving, drinkable juice of medicines and</xml>
<xml>enjoys the pleasure of knowledge, acquires God-given wealth, the procurer</xml>
<xml>of pure food, and the giver of good drinks, the strength of a hero, and the</xml>
<xml>sweet, disease-healing nectar of a glorious person.</xml>
<xml>80. Just as wise sages understand problems with mental force,</xml>
<xml>prepare bullets with lead, and cloths with woollen thread, so do the learned,</xml>
<xml>2M YAjua VEDA</xml>
<xml>an educated wife, teachers and preachers perform sacrifice (yajnaX and a</xml>
<xml>skilled physician arranges for the elegance of affluence.</xml>
<xml>81. Teacher, pupil and examiner, these three divine forces, impart</xml>
<xml>and receive education.</xml>
<xml>With wisdom and deed, they with long hair, perform the sacrifice in</xml>
<xml>diverse ways. We should understand the eternal nature of this sacrifice.</xml>
<xml>Illiterate youths are not entitled to perform sacrifice (yajna). Hide, meat,</xml>
<xml>parched grain should not be used in the yajna for oblation,</xml>
<xml>82. Whomsoever child, a good, intelligent mother gives birth to,</xml>
<xml>that handsome baby with its internal organs, bones and marrow, should be</xml>
<xml>protected on this earth with medicinal juices, like a well, by a physician</xml>
<xml>and his wife, the infusers of life like vital airs.</xml>
<xml>83. The learned wife, with her knowledge, like birth, adorns her</xml>
<xml>beautiful, well built body, and prepares meals, the removers of physical</xml>
<xml>discomforts, available from all sides, ready at hand, the givers of delight</xml>
<xml>like nectar. Her thoughtful husband receives pure ideas from his father</xml>
<xml>and mother free from untruth.</xml>
<xml>84. Those learned persons get progeny, who chase afar folly and ill</xml>
<xml>intention, generate near at hand, by milk and medicinal juices, through</xml>
<xml>generative organ, pure, disease-destroying, children-producing semen, that</xml>
<xml>it present in all substances, and causes harm through excessive discharge.</xml>
<xml>85. A learned doctor, guarding the body against disease, giving us</xml>
<xml>medical directions, removing sickness, realises through his soul the exact</xml>
<xml>nature of disease, and with prescribed food, does not allow our lungs,</xml>
<xml>liver, throat-artery, kidney and bile to be affected.</xml>
<xml>86. Entrails in the body are the cauldron for cooking food in which</xml>
<xml>honey is mixed, bowels are the pans. This earth the bestower of glory is</xml>
<xml>like a well-milking cow. A hawk's wing is the spleen. Navel, the centre</xml>
<xml>of all strength is like the king's cushion. Belly is like a mother.</xml>
<xml>82. Like a well : As well is taken care of, and protected so that its water is not</xml>
<xml>contaminated, so should a child be kept healthy and free from disease by the me of medicines</xml>
<xml>when necessary.</xml>
<xml>83. Like birth : Just as a woman keeps the newly born child neat and clean, so does</xml>
<xml>0h ketp her body clean.</xml>
<xml>80. Jmt as belly digests what we eat, turns out the useless part of the meals, aad</xml>
<xml>utilises their essence, so does the mother teach a child to shun vice and imbibe virtue Jtwt</xml>
<xml>as navel is the centre of the body, from which proceed arteries, so the king sitting on his</xml>
<xml>cushion, i e., gaddi is the centre of hi* government. Just a* a hawk atfacks the enemy and</xml>
<xml>kills him, so doe* the spleen remove all diseases aad discomforts of th body*</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XIX</xml>
<xml>67. A husband full of semen like a pitcher, enjoyer, progenitor of</xml>
<xml>children, taker of good meals, full of nourishments, doer of noble deeds,</xml>
<xml>master of hundreds of speeches, deep like a large pitcher, is like one who</xml>
<xml>is engaged in the execution of his duty. A wife is a small jar of water. It</xml>
<xml>is incumbent upon both to give food to their parents and protect the</xml>
<xml>embryo in the womb.</xml>
<xml>88. Just as a wife, the recipient of semen, at the time of cohabita-</xml>
<xml>tion keeps her head opposite to the head of the husband, and her face</xml>
<xml>opposite to that of his, so should both husband and wife perform together</xml>
<xml>their domestic duties. A husband is a protector like a physician. He</xml>
<xml>lives happily like a child, and with tranquillity produces progeny with</xml>
<xml>penis keen with ardour.</xml>
<xml>89. The immortal eyes are like the planets of the sun and moon.</xml>
<xml>The goat's milk and cooked food give them keenness. Eyelashes are like</xml>
<xml>wheat, and eyebrows are jujube. The white and black parts of the eye</xml>
<xml>spread its beauty.</xml>
<xml>90. Just as a learned lady with her husband, through mutual cloie</xml>
<xml>relations, gives birth to a child, charming like jujubes, so for vigour in</xml>
<xml>the nostril is made the immortal path of breath. The vyan breath goes</xml>
<xml>through the body, guarding it and vying with other breaths, adds to the</xml>
<xml>forces of the nostril</xml>
<xml>01. A learned person acquires yoga, through acts of comprehension,</xml>
<xml>like barley, hears with both ears, uses pure water, exercises organs of action,</xml>
<xml>like sweet honey, performs acts of advancement, controls breath in Su-</xml>
<xml>shurana and concentrates thought in the midst of eyebrows, utters from his</xml>
<xml>mouth God's knowledge All this is the manifestation of His divine</xml>
<xml>power.</xml>
<xml>92- When a yogi visualises God in his soul at the time of Samadhi</xml>
<xml>(concentration) his hair grow long like those of the wolf. His beard and</xml>
<xml>moustache grow like the hair of a tiger. The hair of his head and tonsure</xml>
<xml>87. A husband possessing more force t> compared to a Kumbh, a large pitcher and</xml>
<xml>wife, with less strength to a Kumbhi, a small water jar.</xml>
<xml>90. Control of breath : Praoayam protects a yogi from all afflictions, and being well</xml>
<xml>practised advances his spiritual force, so does an educated mother with good instructions</xml>
<xml>develop her children physically and spiritually.</xml>
<xml>9}, Sushumna :-A particular artery of the human body, said to lie between Ida and</xml>
<xml>Pingala, two of the vessels of the body. The comparison of barley and honey is not clear.</xml>
<xml>92- A yogi generally lives in solitude of forests, where reside wolves, tigers and lions.</xml>
<xml>Due to prolonged and deep concentration his hair grow like those, of these animals who AM</xml>
<xml>his companion*.</xml>
<xml>216 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>grow like those of a lion. His organs are endowed with lustre, glory and</xml>
<xml>royal power.</xml>
<xml>93. Just as a woman devoted to yoga, engrossed in deep meditation,</xml>
<xml>practising the limbs of yoga puts her soul in contemplation, so should</xml>
<xml>husband and wife free from disease like a good physician, practise the parts</xml>
<xml>of yoga and attain to the beauty of supremacy. As men practising yoga</xml>
<xml>live for a hundred years, so should we, full of happiness, realise the immor-</xml>
<xml>tal nature of the soul.</xml>
<xml>94. O yogi, just as an educated wife bears in her womb the nobly-</xml>
<xml>fashioned infant, and an excellent king with the help of the teacher and</xml>
<xml>preacher and the spiritual force of the self-abnegating learned persons</xml>
<xml>(Aptas) controlling the breaths manifests his sovereignty for wealth so</xml>
<xml>shouldst thou do.</xml>
<xml>95. The ghee of animals is eatable and giver of physical strength.</xml>
<xml>The juice of medicines and delicious sugar mixed with milk also add to</xml>
<xml>physical strength. The water yielded by two efficacious agencies, the sun</xml>
<xml>and moon and lightning is also invigorating. The pressed and unpressed</xml>
<xml>medicinal Soma juice acts like nectar.</xml>
<xml>94. Just AS mother safeguards the Infant in her womb, and a king adds to royal</xml>
<xml>power, so should a yogi attain to yoga siddhis. There are eight limbs of yoga : Yam, Nijam,</xml>
<xml>Atan Pranayam, Prat yah ar, Dharana, Dbyana, Samadbi.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XX</xml>
<xml>1. O King thou art the birth place of princely power, and centre of</xml>
<xml>royal family. Let none harm thee, do not harm me.</xml>

<xml>With the wealth of a magnate, for strength of body, riches and fame,</xml>
<xml>do I enthrone thee.</xml>
<xml>4. O famous and truthful king, doer of noble deeds, and dispenser</xml>
<xml>of justice, thou art happy, thou art extremely happy, hence for God the</xml>
<xml>Embodiment of happiness, for the advancement of Vedic knowledge, do I</xml>
<xml>enthrone thee.</xml>
<xml>5. May my head be full of grace, my mouth of fame, my hair and</xml>
<xml>beard, of brilliant sheen, my breath, of light and deathlessness, my eye, of</xml>

<xml>fingers, delightful my bodily organs, and conquering-strength my friend.</xml>
<xml>7. Power and wealth are my arms, deed and heroism are my hands.</xml>
<xml>Soul and heart are my shield against danger.</xml>
<xml>8. My government is my back, my belly, shoulders, neck, hips,</xml>
<xml>thighs, elbows, knees, and all other members of the body are my subjects.</xml>
<xml>9. May my memory, navel, knowledge, anus, my wife's productive</xml>
<xml>womb, my testicles the givers of pleasure through cohabitation, my</xml>
<xml>sovereignty and penis flourish. Standing on my legs and feet, in the</xml>

<xml>3. I : Adhvaryu, the master of the vedas, the representative of the King and tht</xml>
<xml>subjects who presides over the coronation ceremony.</xml>
<xml>3. My : the enthroned King.</xml>
<xml>9. A king should exercise control over all the organs of his body, and try to keep them</xml>
<xml>healthy and efficient.</xml>
<xml>218 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>midst of my subjects, free from favouritism, with even-handed justice,</xml>
<xml>I rule as a king, with full fame.</xml>
<xml>10. I take my stand on princely power and kingship, on horses am</xml>
<xml>I dependent, and on cows, on agencies of administration I depend, on my</xml>
<xml>soul do I depend. On vital breaths am I dependent, and on invigorating</xml>
<xml>cereals do I depend. I depend on justice like the sun and moon. I depend</xml>
<xml>on the company of the learned, and on the spread of knowledge.</xml>
<xml>11. There are three times eleven, i.e., thirty three fine objects</xml>
<xml>imbued with attributes, duties and inherent properties, in this world</xml>
<xml>created by God ; of whom the sun is the most prominent, and which are</xml>
<xml>serviceable to mankind.</xml>
<xml>May the learned persons, with the help of these objects protect me.</xml>

<xml>show to the learned, may God set me free from all that iniquity and</xml>
<xml>fault.</xml>
<xml>15. If in the day-time or at night, we have committed any act of sin,</xml>

<xml>electricity and Yajna. These constitute thirty three devatas, fine objects, of whom the eleven</xml>
<xml>Rudras form a part.</xml>
<xml>12. All the 33 devatas, the farces of nature and the knowledge of all the four vedaf,</xml>
<xml>fulfil man's desires.</xml>
<xml>13. Comparison is made between the parts of the body, and qualities of administration</xml>
<xml>in a state The joint effort of all in a state is like hair. The power of subduing the enemy</xml>
<xml>is like my skin. Just as skin protects me so the spirit of reverence protects a state.</xml>
<xml>14. We ; Teachers and preachers.</xml>
<xml>Agni may also mean a learned person illumined like fire with the light of different</xml>
<xml>branches of knowledge.</xml>
<xml>15. Vayu may also mean, a learned Apta.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XX 219</xml>
<xml>16. If when awake or in our sleep we have committed acts of sin,</xml>
<xml>May God set me free from all that iniquity and fault.</xml>
<xml>17. Each fault in village or in forest, society or mind, each sinful</xml>
<xml>act that we have done to Sudra or Vaishya, or in preventing any body</xml>
<xml>from religious performances, even of that sin , O God, Thou art the</xml>
<xml>expiation.</xml>
<xml>18. O adorable God, giver of divine wisdom, supreme of all, save</xml>
<xml>me from the sin of taunting the vital breaths and inviolable cows,</xml>
<xml>O lord of celibacy and knowledge, thou art a slow-walker, giver of</xml>
<xml>happiness, and full of delight, save us from distressing violence. Thou</xml>
<xml>avertest the offence committed by the learned towards the learned and</xml>
<xml>the ordinary mortals towards mortals.</xml>
<xml>19. O King, let thy heart be deep like the ocean. May thou</xml>
<xml>obtain food, fruits and drinkable juices. May water and medicinal herbs</xml>
<xml>be pleasant for us like a friend. May these be inimical for those who</xml>
<xml>dislike us and whom we dislike.</xml>
<xml>20. O learned persons pure like water and breath, purify me from</xml>
<xml>sin, just as a ripe fruit is released from the tree, or as an exhausted person</xml>
<xml>full of sweat is freed from dirt by bathing, or as ghee is purified by a</xml>
<xml>sieve.</xml>
<xml>21. May we realising God from all sides, excellently attain to Him,</xml>

<xml>always prosper, having realized the Effulgent Lord, the Guide of the</xml>

<xml>24. O God, the Fulfiller of vows, concentrating myself on Thee,</xml>
<xml>I plunge in divine meditation like fuel in fire, whereby I acquire the</xml>
<xml>vow of truth and faith.</xml>
<xml>Being initiated in celibacy and gaining knowledge, I kindle Thee.</xml>
<xml>25. I consider that society or country to be ideal, where the civil</xml>
<xml>and military forces work together harmoniously, where the learned civil</xml>
<xml>administrators cooperate with the commanders of the army.</xml>
<xml>26. Fain would I know that holy God, where birth and death un-</xml>
<xml>known, where in complete accordance reside soul and God side by side.</xml>
<xml>27. Let thy soul be united with God. Let each joint of thine be</xml>
<xml>full of vigour. Let thy noble nature guard thy wealth. Let the imperish-</xml>
<xml>able sap of God's devotion be for thy joy.</xml>
<xml>28. Those who aspire after power, for delight pour in the stomach</xml>
<xml>the sap of medicines, drink it, receive it excellently, and purify themselves,</xml>

<xml>the teacher and the preacher. Thou art educationally connected with</xml>
<xml>them. I accept thee for didactic speech, for lofty supremacy, for effective</xml>

<xml>and for full protection.</xml>
<xml>26. In the state of emancipation soul and God live together. There soul is free from</xml>
<xml>the pangs of hunger and thirst, where the distress of birth and death is not felt.</xml>
<xml>28. He who reviles the efficacy of medicines does not improve his body and foul.</xml>

<xml>Mornings, with forward light, long-active, waxing mighty, with thirty three</xml>
<xml>supernatural powers of nature, the Thunder-wielder, smites dead the cloud,</xml>
<xml>and throws light on the portals, so do thou with the help of warriors kill</xml>
<xml>the foes, and open the doors of knowledge and religion.</xml>

<xml>reputed, valiant, well-mannered, vigilant husbands, seek from all sides the.</xml>
<xml>asylum of wives, advanced in knowledge, so shouldst ye do.</xml>
<xml>41. O people, just as Dawn and Night fair in appearance, coupled</xml>
<xml>with the darkness of night, richly-yielding, with growing light, accompany</xml>
<xml>the sun, long-extended, illuminator of worlds like the Earth, lofty, so</xml>
<xml>should ye keep contact with an expressive heroic person.</xml>
<xml>42. Teacher and Preacher, companions of the learned, good orga-</xml>
<xml>nisers, charitable, pleasant-voiced, first to officiate on a yajna, leaders of</xml>
<xml>multitude of people, who with sweet oblation increase the ancient light</xml>
<xml>and glory, are fit to be adored by all</xml>
<xml>222 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>43. Vidya Sabha, Dharma Sabha and Rajya Sabha, all three bent</xml>

<xml>through knowledge and authority, like wedded dames, taking charge of</xml>
<xml>State's administration, with prowess, skill and affluence, preserve the</xml>

<xml>performs sacrifice with edible objects like honey and butter, and tastes</xml>
<xml>them well, remains immune from disease.</xml>
<xml>46. Just as a strong, exalted, heroic person, overpowers the</xml>
<xml>violent foe, but is pleased with an upright, straight-forward man with</xml>

<xml>destroyer of the ignoble, affable, the giver of glory, deserving of invoca-</xml>
<xml>tion, the Subduer of the foes, the preserver of administration, quick in</xml>
<xml>action, adored by the multitude, and the castigator of the enemy's army.</xml>
<xml>O Bounteous Lord, may thou give us happiness.</xml>
<xml>51. The ruler, a good protector, accompanied by his excellent</xml>
<xml>assistants, full of wealth, diffuser of happiness, should protect his subjects</xml>
<xml>by administering justice, remove the opponents, render all free from fear,</xml>
<xml>and himself be fearless, whereby we may be the lords of vigour.</xml>
<xml>52. May the ruler, our good preserver, with his noble family</xml>
<xml>members, a father unto us, drive from us away, even from far and near,</xml>
<xml>our foe men.</xml>
<xml>May we dwell in the auspicious favour of and obey the orders of the</xml>
<xml>ruler, who is fit to perform acts of sacrifice.</xml>
<xml>53. O Mighty Commander, go forth, with excellent steeds having</xml>
<xml>tails like peacock plumes, to conquer thy foes. Let none check thy course,</xml>
<xml>as fowlers capture the bird. Come unto us like a skilful archer.</xml>
<xml>54. O wealthy citizens, just as learned persons laud the slayer of</xml>
<xml>foes, who is powerful, whose arms wield weapons, so should ye. Thus</xml>
<xml>praised may he guard our wealth in men and cattle. Ye heroes, preserve</xml>
<xml>us evermore with blessings.</xml>
<xml>55. Just as in this world, vedic text, like the milch-cow, multiplies</xml>
<xml>our pure glory and wealth, so should I perfect it. O men and women just</xml>
<xml>as heated, radiant, impelled, burning, unified fire protects the world, so</xml>
<xml>should I protect it.</xml>
<xml>56. O people, just as both husband and wife, conversant with</xml>
<xml>medical science, guardians of the body, accomplished with noble nature</xml>
<xml>and good dealings, possessing vedic knowledge and sweetness in speech in</xml>
<xml>this world, preserve by different devices wealth and the people for the</xml>
<xml>king, so ye should contact them.</xml>
<xml>57. Both kinds of physicians, well versed in the science of medicine,</xml>
<xml>for the removal of ailment, in this world, prescribe medicine skilfully and</xml>
<xml>with a sweet voice. May speech full of commendable learning, coupled</xml>
<xml>with words of praise from men, lead to affluence, conducive to happiness.</xml>
<xml>57. There are two kinds of physicians : one who treats the physical ailments, and the</xml>
<xml>other who deals with mental maladies. The word Nagnahu (HH$) in the ver?e has been trans*</xml>
<xml>lated by Griffith as the drug used for fermenting the sura (^T), Rishi Dayananda translates it</xml>
<xml>AS 'conducive to happiness. 1</xml>

<xml>medicines, always remain happy.</xml>
<xml>60. Just as highly applauded lightning pervading the sun and moon,</xml>
<xml>illumines directions and gates, and engulfs the Earth and Heaven, so do I</xml>
<xml>an educated woman accomplish my desires.</xml>
<xml>61. O learned persons, just as the sun and moon, of fair hue, at</xml>
<xml>dawn and night, by day and in the evening, are adorned by manifesting</xml>
<xml>lightning, so should ye adorn yourselves with the noble qualities of soul</xml>

<xml>strong, gladdening, well-begotten juice of medicines.</xml>
<xml>64. May the teacher and preacher, imparters of knowledge, a highly</xml>
<xml>educated mother, a skilled workman, give us glory, fame, and diverse</xml>
<xml>beautiful objects for the consummation of our affluence.</xml>

<xml>a milch-cow, and just as a mighty tree growing with the passage of seasons,</xml>
<xml>with its sweet juice and edible products fulfils our desires under the</xml>
<xml>advice of physicians, so may I fulfil my desires.</xml>
<xml>66. O physicians, just as we attain to supremacy, with measured</xml>
<xml>rice diet, with speech full of instruction, knowledge and sweetness, with</xml>
<xml>cows' milk and its products, so should ye use the juice of medicines, highly</xml>
<xml>efficacious and well prepared.</xml>

<xml>Prishtha may mean season as well. Swami D&yananda has translated the word as subtle</xml>
<xml>questionings.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XXIII</xml>
<xml>1. God is the Creator of the universe, its one Lord, the Sustainer of</xml>
<xml>luminous objects like the sun. He was present before the creation of the</xml>
<xml>world. He sustains this Earth and the Sun in past, present and future.</xml>
<xml>Let us worship with self dedication of our soul, Him, the Embodiment of</xml>
<xml>happiness.</xml>
<xml>2. O God, Thou art realisable through yoga. I serve Thee and</xml>
<xml>accept Thee as Protector of the King who takes care of his subjects. This</xml>
<xml>primordial matter and the Sun testify to Thy Greatness. Thy Majesty is</xml>
<xml>discernible in the day and year. Thy Majesty is seen in the wind and</xml>
<xml>firmament. Thy Majesty is traceable in the luminous Sun. For all that,</xml>
<xml>for Thy protecting greatness and for the learned persons, we always sing</xml>
<xml>praises.</xml>
<xml>3. God by His grandeur is the sole Ruler of the moving world that</xml>
<xml>breathes and slumbers. He is the Sovereign Lord of these men and cattle.</xml>
<xml>Let us worship with devotion, Him, the Embodiment of happiness.</xml>
<xml>4. O God Thou art realisable through yoga. I serve Thee and accept</xml>
<xml>Thee as Protector of the king who takes care of his subjects. This water</xml>
<xml>and moon testify to Thy greatness. Thy Majesty is seen in the night and</xml>
<xml>year. Thy Majesty is found in the Earth and fire. Thy Majesty is dis-</xml>
<xml>cernible in the immortal worlds and the moon. For all that, for Thy</xml>
<xml>protecting greatness and for the learned persons, we always sing praises.</xml>
<xml>5. They, who unite their souls with God, Who pervades all station-</xml>
<xml>ary objects, and protects the vital parts of our body; shine in Him like</xml>
<xml>beams in the Sun,</xml>
<xml>6. Just as experts yoke to the chariot two beautiful horses, con-</xml>
<xml>trolled with difficulty and through diverse devices; tawny, stout, our</xml>
<xml>bearers from one place to the other, so do the yogis yoke their organs of</xml>
<xml>sense, mind, and vital breaths to God.</xml>
<xml>7. O laudable learned person, just as artisans control the beautiful</xml>
<xml>diffused form of electricity, swift like the wind, and erect electrical con-</xml>
<xml>trivances worked with water, so do ye prepare with the aid of electricity</xml>
<xml>a fast moving machine, that takes us from one place to the other.</xml>
<xml>2. Day and year : The regularity of time, the rising and setting of the sun in time all</xml>
<xml>the year round, indicate the Majesty of God.</xml>
<xml>CHAPtER XXIII 24?</xml>
<xml>8. O king, the protector of his subjects, the Vasus approach thee</xml>
<xml>with Vedic verses in Gayatri Metre, Rudras approach thee with verses</xml>
<xml>in Trishtup metre, Adityas approach thee with verses in Jagati</xml>
<xml>metre, eat thou this food, O learned people eat ye this food pre-</xml>
<xml>pared from barley and cow's milk and its products, and move on Earth,</xml>
<xml>Ether, Heaven, and distinct planets moving in their orbits,</xml>
<xml>9. Who moveth singly and alone ? Who is brought forth to life</xml>
<xml>again ? What is the remedy of cold ? What is the vast field for</xml>
<xml>production ?</xml>
<xml>10. The Sun moves singly and alone. The Moon is brought to life</xml>
<xml>again. Fire is the remedy of cold. The Earth is the vast field for</xml>
<xml>production.</xml>
<xml>11. What is the primary thought? What is the bird of mighty</xml>
<xml>size ? What is the majestic beautiful thing ? What absorbs light ?</xml>
<xml>12. Rain is the primary thought. Fire is like the mighty bird,</xml>
<xml>Earth is the majestic, beautiful object that protects us with corn. Night</xml>
<xml>absorbs light.</xml>
<xml>13. O student, may air help thee with cooked viands, black-necked</xml>
<xml>fire with powers of digestion, fig tree with clouds, Shalmali tree with its</xml>
<xml>increase. May the stallion, that moves on the roads the chariot, bestower</xml>
<xml>of happiness come unto thee on his four feet. May the learned scholar of</xml>
<xml>the four Vedas, free from the darkness of ignorance fill us with virtues.</xml>
<xml>May we offer him food.</xml>
<xml>14. Body is strengthened through penance, warm like the sun's</xml>
<xml>rays. Organs are also strengthened through penance. Vital breaths</xml>
<xml>are invigorated through penance. A learned yogi advances spiritually</xml>
<xml>through the attainment of love for God.</xml>
<xml>15. O seeker after knowledge, thyself strengthen the body, thyself</xml>
<xml>walk in the company of the learned, and thyself serve them. Let not thy</xml>
<xml>greatness be marred by any one.</xml>
<xml>16. O Soul thou art immortal and indestructible. By fair paths</xml>
<xml>8. Vasus, Rudras and Adityas are the learned persons observing celibacy for 24, 36 and</xml>
<xml>48 years.</xml>
<xml>9-12. In 9th and 10th, and llth, 12th verses there are questions and answers.</xml>
<xml>13. Shalmali The silk-cotton tree. A lofty and thorny tree with red flowers. It is</xml>
<xml>called <WT tree.</xml>
<xml>Black-necked : Fire with its dark smoke.</xml>
<xml>Four feet : with full ipeed,</xml>
<xml>248 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>thou cultivatest noble qualities. May the resplendent God place thee</xml>
<xml>in that place t where the godly yogis dwell, and derive pleasure.</xml>
<xml>17. O seeker after knowledge, in this world, fire is a thing of</xml>
<xml>beauty. Just as learned persons perform yajnas with it, so shouldst thou</xml>
<xml>do. Just as a learned person masters this beautiful place of sacrifice, so</xml>
<xml>shouldst thou do. If thou wilt properly manage the place of yajna, fire</xml>
<xml>will manifest itself as a thing worth seeing. Drink thou the waters puri-</xml>
<xml>fied by the yajna.</xml>
<xml>Air is a thing of beauty. Just as learned persons perform yajnas</xml>
<xml>with it, so shouldst thou do. Just as a learned person masters the atmos-</xml>
<xml>phere, the home of air, so shouldst thou do. If thou wilt master the</xml>
<xml>atmosphere, air will look as a beautiful thing. Breathe thou the air puri-</xml>
<xml>fied by the yajna. Sun is a thing of beauty. The learned perform yajnas</xml>
<xml>with its aid. Just as a learned person acquires full knowledge about the</xml>
<xml>sun, so shouldst thou do. If thou wilt do it, sun will appear as a beauti-</xml>
<xml>ful thing unto thee. Enjoy thou the beams of the sun purified through</xml>
<xml>the yajna, and reigning in the universe.</xml>
<xml>18. O mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, I cannot be sub-</xml>
<xml>dued by a man, who, though he be quick like a horse, and in full posses-</xml>
<xml>sion of wealth, the bringer of good furtune, and sustainer of an ease-</xml>
<xml>loving person, but lies in idle slumber. I utter truthful speech for the</xml>
<xml>sustenance of vital breath. I use instructive speech for warding off</xml>
<xml>misery. I speak the truth for the preservation of my soul that pervades</xml>
<xml>the body.</xml>
<xml>19. O God, we invoke Thee, the troop-lord of troops. We invoke</xml>
<xml>Thee, the Lord of the beloved ones. We invoke Thee, the Lord of the</xml>
<xml>treasure of knowledge. O God, all beings reside in Thee. Thou art my</xml>
<xml>judge. I know Thee full well free from birth, the Sustainer of Matter</xml>
<xml>that keeps the universe in its womb. Thou knowest Matter.</xml>
<xml>20. The King and his subjects in unison, magnify the four stages</xml>
<xml>18. One should never lapse into idleness, though he be the master of wealth. A</xml>
<xml>wealthy person should be active and enterprising.</xml>
<xml>20. Dharma : Law, custom, piety, duty, justice, merit, character, the soul.</xml>
<xml>Artha : Worldly prosperity.</xml>
<xml>Kama : Affection, object of desire.</xml>
<xml>Moksha : Liberation, deliverance.</xml>
<xml>Griffith has not translated the 10 verses 20-29 saying that these stanzas are not</xml>
<xml>reproducible even in the semi-obscurity of a learned European language ; and stanzas 30, 31</xml>
<xml>would be unintelligible without them.</xml>
<xml>Ubbat and Mahidhar have translated the?e stanzas in an obscene language unfit for</xml>
<xml>reproduction. Swami Payananda has given to the world their correct interpretation,</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XXIII 249</xml>
<xml>of Dharma, Arth, Kama, Moksha, wherewith they reside happily in their</xml>
<xml>country. The King, the chastiser of the wicked, full of knowledge, the</xml>
<xml>possessor of strength and prowess, lends valour to his subjects.</xml>
<xml>21 O powerful King, punish the immoral person residing amongst</xml>
<xml>women, and the degraded woman living amongst men, with feet upwards,</xml>
<xml>and head downwards 5 spread happiness amongst your people, and est-</xml>
<xml>ablish your well established reign of justice.</xml>
<xml>22. The King establishes his rule over his subjects, which aspiring</xml>
<xml>after happiness, acquire it bit by bit. His subjects are weak like the tiny</xml>
<xml>sparrow. He realises land revenue from the people to be spent on their</xml>
<xml>advancement.</xml>
<xml>23. O harmless King, don't utter untruth before us. Let not thy</xml>
<xml>tongue utter meaningless words like a prattler. A King who has got no</xml>
<xml>control over his tongue will be extirpated like a weak sparrow, and de-</xml>
<xml>frauded by his subjects.</xml>
<xml>24. O king, thy forbearing and loving mother, and thy father</xml>
<xml>brilliant and nourishing like the sun, rule over the prosperity and riches</xml>
<xml>of the sovereignty of this mundane universe. Thy father has beautified</xml>
<xml>his rule for his subjects. I, as his subect, do love him dearly.</xml>
<xml>25. O master of all the four vedas, thy mother patient like the</xml>
<xml>Earth, and thy father shining like the Sun, enjoy with knowledge and</xml>
<xml>grandeur the mastery of the universe. Thy mouth is eager to speak, but</xml>
<xml>thou shouldst not talk much.</xml>
<xml>26. O king, like the man taking a load up to the mountain, always</xml>
<xml>lift up these excellent subjects of thine full of sovereign wealth.</xml>
<xml>Having acquired these precious subjects attain to prosperity, just</xml>
<xml>as an agriculturist in a cool breeze separates corn from the chaff and</xml>
<xml>improves physically by its use.</xml>
<xml>27. O learned persons among the subjects, elevate this king in all</xml>
<xml>administrative designs, as a labourer takes a load up to the mountain.</xml>
<xml>Having thus contributed to the prosperity of the State, aspire after pure</xml>
<xml>deeds, like the corn purified in a cool breeze.</xml>
<xml>28. The king and officials, who contribute to the grandeur of their</xml>
<xml>subjects in part or full, and both make them energetic, tremble when they</xml>
<xml>unjustly realise taxes from them, just as tiny fishes tremble in the</xml>
<xml>water below the cow's hooves,</xml>
<xml>25. A learned person should not talk much without purpose. He should follow the</xml>
<xml>maxim 'Speech is silver, silence is gold.' Too much talking is not a sign of wisdom.</xml>
<xml>250 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>29. Just as we distinguish between man and woman from their</xml>
<xml>organs, so we realise truth from visible evidence. Learned persons with</xml>
<xml>the help of truth acquire humility and their desired objects.</xml>
<xml>30. A licentious king who squeezes money out of his subjects, like</xml>
<xml>the deer who destroys the barley field, cannnot see his people thrive. A</xml>
<xml>Shudra maid-servant who has got illicit connection with her master, does</xml>
<xml>not desire the progress of her family.</xml>
<xml>31. A King, who destroys his subjects, like the deer the barley</xml>
<xml>field, cannot see his people thrive.</xml>
<xml>A Shudra servant who has got illicit connection with his mistress,</xml>
<xml>does not desire the progress of his family.</xml>
<xml>32. I sing the praise of God, obtainable by him who deeply medi-</xml>
<xml>tates upon Him, the Remover of miseries, and full of splendour. May He</xml>
<xml>strengthen our vital breaths, and prolong the days we have to live.</xml>
<xml>33. O King, may the vedic verses in Gayatri, Trishtup, Jagati,</xml>
<xml>Anushtup, Pankti, Brihati, Ushni, Kakup and metres uttered by the</xml>
<xml>subjects, pacify thee.</xml>
<xml>34. O King may the two-footed, four-footed, three-footed, six-footed</xml>
<xml>metrical divisions, with different metres or one uniform metre, uttered by</xml>
<xml>the subjects pacify thee.</xml>
<xml>31. A king who plunders and teases his subjects, is like the deer who eats barley in the</xml>
<xml>field, and doesn't allow it grow.</xml>
<xml>Similarly the King who impoverishes and destroys his subjects is like the male servant</xml>
<xml>who violates the chastity of his mistress, and thereby nullifies her dignity, fame and wealth.</xml>
<xml>33. Gayatri :- that protects the singer.</xml>
<xml>Trishtup:- that protects u? from mental, material and natural afflictions.</xml>
<xml>Jagati :- Diffused like the earth.</xml>
<xml>Anushtup'- Whereby worldly afflictions are warded off.</xml>
<xml>Ushnik:- Whereby we sing early in the morning.</xml>
<xml>Brihati :- Full of deep significance. *</xml>
<xml>Kakup'- Full with the meaning of elegant stanzas.</xml>
<xml>ftsfli^Ri: I WTo 13-2-10-2.</xml>
<xml>Suchi means subjects. Suchi means needle, just as a needle sews and join c together the broken</xml>
<xml>parts of a cloth, so do there verses concentrate the mind of seeker after knowledge on God.</xml>
<xml>34. Dvipada:- Brahmcharis, Chatushpada :- Grihasthis.</xml>
<xml>Tripada:- Vanprasthis.</xml>
<xml>Shatpada;- Seekers after emancipation, Moksha.</xml>
<xml>Vichhanda :- Self sacrificing.</xml>
<xml>Satchhanda:- Equipped with special spiritual resources.</xml>
<xml>The verse may also mean :- May the Brahmcharis, Grihasthis, Vanprasthis, Sanyaais, the</xml>
<xml>aspirers after Moksha, self sacrificing perrons and those equipped with special spiritual</xml>
<xml>resources pacify thee.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XXIII 251</xml>
<xml>35. May the Mahanamni and Revati vcdic verses, all far spread</xml>
<xml>Supreme Regions, the lightning in the cVuds, and the voices uttered by the</xml>
<xml>subjects, satisfy the king. t</xml>
<xml>36. O learned teachress, the girls, who with sharp intellect, obey</xml>
<xml>thy order, become the wives of learned persons. O unmarried girl, the</xml>
<xml>wives of learned persons, \Uio through careful inspection learn the art of</xml>
<xml>cooking, pure like the regions, grant thee knowledge and peace.</xml>
<xml>37. Affectionate, fascinating amorous wives, well trained in domestic</xml>
<xml>economy, according to religious rites, are united for life with powerful</xml>
<xml>husbands full of noble qualities, and placed under their protection. May</xml>
<xml>they tranquil and peaceful, bound by the ties of affection, enjoy life.</xml>
<xml>38. O King, just as farmers reap the barley-corn, winnow and</xml>
<xml>protect it ; so shouldst thou arrange for food for those engaged in the</xml>
<xml>contemplation of God.</xml>
<xml>39. O student, who admonishes thee ? Who imparts thee sound</xml>
<xml>instruction ? Who pacifies thy organs ? Who is thy teacher who is well</xml>
<xml>versed in religious lore and performs the ya jnas ?</xml>
<xml>40. May the truly learned persons, bestowersof peace, give necess-</xml>
<xml>ary instructions for rearing the subjects. O people, may they pacify ye</xml>
<xml>by means of King's dignity, and peaceful expedients.</xml>
<xml>41. O King, may day and night, half months and months, affording</xml>
<xml>felicity, adorn the different periods of thy life. May the learned remove</xml>
<xml>thy doubt.</xml>
<xml>42. O male and female students, may the learned teachers and</xml>
<xml>preachers give ye special instructions ;and thereby eliminate your weak-</xml>
<xml>nesses. May they examine each joint of your limbs. May your mother</xml>
<xml>and other female relations bound in the ties of affection, give ye similar</xml>
<xml>instructions.</xml>
<xml>43. O female student or mistress, may Sky, Earth, Space, Air, Sun</xml>
<xml>and Moon with the stars of heaven, appease each organ of thine, grant</xml>
<xml>success to thy undertaking ; and prepare a nice, true, beautiful world for</xml>
<xml>thee.</xml>
<xml>44. O student just as the Earth contributes to the walfare of vital</xml>
<xml>and minor organs of thy body, thy bones and marrow, so thy teachers with</xml>
<xml>their qualities, actions and noble nature add to thy pleasure.</xml>
<xml>35. Mahanamnis :- Whose name is great : nine verses of the Samaveda in Sakvari</xml>
<xml>metre.</xml>
<xml>Revatis J- Verses from which the Raivata Saman is formed, so named from Rig Veda</xml>
<xml>I. 30. 13 in which the word revati, splendid, or wealthy, occurs,</xml>
<xml>252 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>45. Who moveth singly and alone ? Who is brought forth to life</xml>
<xml>again ? What is the remedy of cold ? What is the vast field for pro-</xml>
<xml>duction.</xml>
<xml>46. The sun moves singly and alone. The moon is brought to life</xml>
<xml>again. Fire is the remedy of cold. Earth is the vast field for production.</xml>
<xml>47. What lustre is like the sun's light ? What lake is equal to</xml>
<xml>the sea ? What is more spacious than the Earth ? What thing is that</xml>
<xml>which is beyond measure.</xml>
<xml>48. God is lustre like the sun. Heaven is a flood to match the sea.</xml>
<xml>Sun is vaster than the Earth. Beyond all measure is speech.</xml>
<xml>49. O God, Friend of the learned I ask, for information, if Thou in</xml>
<xml>spirit hast pervaded the universe. Is this created world contained in the</xml>
<xml>three steps in which Vishnu is worshipped ?</xml>
<xml>50. I pervade those three steps in which resides the whole of this</xml>
<xml>universe. This Earth and Heaven I encircle in a moment with a part of</xml>
<xml>My might. Even beyond Heaven am I.</xml>
<xml>51. What are the things which God hath entered in? What are the</xml>
<xml>things which God hath contained within Him ? This riddle we propose</xml>
<xml>to thee, O knower of the vedas 5 whereby we become great. Pray tell us</xml>
<xml>what mystery lies in it.</xml>
<xml>52. Within five things hath God found entrance. These things</xml>
<xml>hath God within Him established, O questioner, this is the thought</xml>
<xml>which I return in answer. Though thou art wise, yet thou art not my</xml>
<xml>superior in wisdom.</xml>
<xml>53. O learned person, I ask of thee.</xml>
<xml>What is accumulated in time without beginning ? What is the</xml>
<xml>great source of creation ? What is the majestic thing ?</xml>
<xml>What absorbs the bodies.</xml>
<xml>45-46. See 23-9, 10. The repetition of these verses is not clear, No commentator has</xml>
<xml>explained it.</xml>
<xml>49. Vishnu God who permeates all objects.</xml>
<xml>There steps : Creation, sustenance, and Dissolution; or Earth, Space, and Sky, or</xml>
<xml>name, birth and place.</xml>
<xml>50. I :-God.</xml>
<xml>Three steps .'Birth, name and place.</xml>
<xml>51. Whereby : with the knowledge or solution of which riddle,</xml>
<xml>52. Five Things : Five elements, Water, Air, Fire, Earth, and space.</xml>
<xml>53. The verse is the same as 23-11 but the interpretation is different,</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XXIII 253</xml>
<xml>54. O questioner, know that, lightning is accumulated in the</xml>
<xml>beginning. Intellect is the source of creation. Matter is the majestic</xml>
<xml>thing. Dissolution absorbs all bodies.</xml>
<xml>55. O learned person, what appears and disappears again and</xml>
<xml>again ? Who eats the corn-fields again and again ? What moves with</xml>
<xml>rapid spring and bound again and again ? What glides and winds along</xml>
<xml>the path of water ?</xml>
<xml>56. O questioner know, that eternal matter resolves the world in</xml>
<xml>itself at the time of dissolution, Porcupine destroys the corn-fields.</xml>
<xml>Like hare the air moves with leaps and bounds. Cloud creeps winding</xml>
<xml>on the path.</xml>
<xml>57. How many supports hath this world got ? How many are the</xml>
<xml>means of its creation ? How many things are worth bartering ? How</xml>
<xml>many things kindle knowledge ? How many Hotas worship in due</xml>
<xml>season ? O learned fellow, here I ask thee of the knowledge of these</xml>
<xml>subjects.</xml>
<xml>58. This world has got six seasons as its supports. Hundreds of</xml>
<xml>things like water etc. are the means of its creation. Countless things are</xml>
<xml>worth using and bartering. Three things kindle knowledge. Seven Hotas</xml>
<xml>perform yajna in due season.</xml>
<xml>O questioner I explain to thee these different topics of knowledge.</xml>
<xml>59. Who knoweth the paramount lord of this world ?</xml>
<xml>Who knoweth the Heaven, the Earth, and the wide space between</xml>
<xml>them?</xml>
<xml>Who knoweth the creator of the mighty Sun ? Who knoweth the</xml>
<xml>Moon, and whence she was generated ?</xml>
<xml>60. O questioner I know the paramount Lord of this world. I</xml>
<xml>know the Heaven, the Earth, and the wide space between them. I know</xml>
<xml>54. Intellect :~*</xml>
<xml>Dissolution HOT</xml>
<xml>The verse is the same as 23-12 but the interpreation is different.</xml>
<xml>57. This world has been described as a king of yajna.</xml>
<xml>58. Three things :- Spiritual, physical and natural objects (Dayananda) ; or child-</xml>
<xml>hood, manhood and old age ; or fire, lightning and sun ; or summer, winter, and rainy season.</xml>
<xml>Seven Hotas : -Five breaths, mind and soul according to Swami Dayananda's interpre-</xml>
<xml>tation. Some consider seven rays of the sun as seven Hotas, some commentators interpret</xml>
<xml>seven breaths in the head as seven Hotas.</xml>
<xml>1 ; a learned person.</xml>
<xml>60. Matter is the material and God the efficient cause of the universe. God has</xml>
<xml>created the Sun and the Moon.</xml>
<xml>254 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>the efficient and physical causes of the mighty Sun. I know the Moon,</xml>
<xml>and her Creator</xml>
<xml>61. I ask thee of Earth's extremest limit, Where is the centre of</xml>
<xml>the world, I ask thee ? I ask thee of the strength of the powerful stout</xml>
<xml>person. I ask of the highest space where speech abideth.</xml>
<xml>62. This equator is the Earth's extremest limit. This Adorable</xml>
<xml>God imbued with qualities is the controller of the world. This effica-</xml>
<xml>cious Soma, the King of medicines is the strength of a stout person.</xml>

<xml>in the body? water-fountain from tears; thunderbolt from the rheum of</xml>
<xml>eyes; objects worth protection from blood; marvellous things from limbs ;</xml>
<xml>stars from their beauty ; earth from skin that covers the blood and flesh.</xml>
<xml>Use truthful language for an energetic person.</xml>
<xml>10. God, the possessor of resplendent planets, existed before the</xml>
<xml>creation of the world. He is the One Lord of all created beings. He</xml>
<xml>sustains the Earth, the Sun and the created world. May we worship</xml>
<xml>with devotion, Him, the Illuminator and Giver of pleasure.</xml>
<xml>11. God by his grandeur is the sole Ruler of the moving world that</xml>
<xml>breathes and slumbers. He is the Lord of men and cattle. May we</xml>
<xml>worship with devotion, Him the Illuminator and Giver of happiness.</xml>
<xml>12. By Whose might, are these snow-clad mountains standing, and</xml>
<xml>men call the atmosphere filled water. His possession. Whose arms are</xml>
<xml>8. Just as sky rains water, so kidneys discharge urine. Just as lakes are full of water, so</xml>
<xml>flanks are full of blood.</xml>
<xml>Just as waters rise from the sea, rain on the Earth and produce medicinal herbs and food-</xml>
<xml>stuffs, so the essence of meals rises from the belly, reaches each and every part of the body,</xml>
<xml>and strenghtens our skin-hair and flesh.</xml>
<xml>Gastric fluid :-The digestive fire of the stomach. Just as this fire digests the food, and</xml>
<xml>converts it into blood, so ordinary fire burns timber and reduces it to ashes.</xml>
<xml>Sea is like : Just as all rivers run into sea, so all meals go into the belly.</xml>
<xml>9. Just as the heat of the body enlivens all organs, so the medicinal herbs grow through</xml>
<xml>frost</xml>
<xml>10. CM3-4, 23-1,</xml>
<xml>11. Cf23-3,</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XXV 265</xml>
<xml>these heavenly regions. May we worship with devotion, Him the</xml>
<xml>Illuminator and Giver of happiness.</xml>
<xml>13. God is the giver of spiritual force, and physical strength. His</xml>
<xml>commandments all the learned persons acknowledge. He is the maker</xml>
<xml>of all laws. His support is life immortal and transgression of His Law</xml>
<xml>is death. May we worship with devotion, Him the Illuminator and Giver</xml>
<xml>of happiness.</xml>
<xml>14. May auspicious force of wisdom come to us from every side,</xml>
<xml>continual, unhindered, and as remover of afflictions. May thereby the</xml>
<xml>learned persons, our guardians, advanced in age, attend our assembly day</xml>
<xml>by day for our gain.</xml>
<xml>15. May the auspicious favour of the learned be ours. May the</xml>
<xml>bounty of the righteous fill us with virtues. May we devoutly seek the</xml>
<xml>friendship of the learned. May they extend our life that we may live.</xml>
<xml>16. We, through vedic speech, accepted by our ancestors; long</xml>
<xml>through mutual emulation for a teacher and a preacher, honest, guardian</xml>
<xml>of the people, inviolable, giver of prosperity, friendly, completely wise,</xml>
<xml>noble, and affluent. May auspicious vedic speech grant us all felicity.</xml>
<xml>17. O teachers and preachers, firm like the Earth, ye both hear from</xml>
<xml>us what we have read. May the wind waft to us that pleasant medicine.</xml>
<xml>May respectable Earth and fostering Sun secure it for us. May clouds the</xml>
<xml>producers of herb and givers of joy secure us that medicine.</xml>
<xml>18. Him we invoke for aid who reigns supreme, the Lord of all that</xml>
<xml>stands or moves, and inspirer of wisdom. May He the Nourisher of all,</xml>
<xml>our Keeper and our Guard Non-violent, promote, the increase of our</xml>
<xml>wealth for our good.</xml>
<xml>19. May the Master of vast knowledge, may Mighty God prosper</xml>
<xml>us. May the Nourisher of all, the Author of all the vedas prosper us.</xml>
<xml>May He the Giver of all comforts like the horse prosper us. May</xml>
<xml>God the Lord of all the elements of Nature vouchsafe us prosperity.</xml>
<xml>20. Let all the learned persons, stout in body, followers of the</xml>
<xml>mother veda, moving in glory, visitors of battle-fields, fire-tongued, con-</xml>
<xml>templative, brilliant in knowledge like the Sun, come hither for our</xml>
<xml>protection.</xml>
<xml>16. Students acquire knowledge from teachers through mutual competition and emulation.</xml>
<xml>We-students.</xml>
<xml>19. Just as a horse takes us from one place to the other and gives us pleasure, so does</xml>
<xml>God give us happiness by fulfiling our wants.</xml>
<xml>20. Hither :-In our country or yajna.</xml>
<xml>266 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>21. O sociable learned persons, may we with our ears listen to what</xml>
<xml>is good, and with our eyes see what is good.</xml>
<xml>With limbs and bodies firm may we extolling God lead a life conducive</xml>
<xml>to the good of the sages.</xml>
<xml>22. O learned persons, may we live in your company for a hundred</xml>
<xml>years. Let not our bodies decay before that period, in which old age our</xml>
<xml>sons become fathers in turn. Break ye not in the midst our course of</xml>
<xml>fleeting life.</xml>
<xml>23. Immortal is the heaven, Immortal is the atmosphere, Matter the</xml>
<xml>mother of all is immortal. Immortal is Father God.</xml>
<xml>Immortal is the soul that nourishes the body. All divine objects like</xml>
<xml>the Earth are immortal. Five vital breaths are immortal. All that is born</xml>
<xml>and shall be born is immortal becuase of its immortal cause.</xml>
<xml>24. May not the friendly, glorious, and just king ; nor the noble</xml>
<xml>souls shorten our life ; so that we may display our valour in war, like a</xml>
<xml>fleeting, efficient horse.</xml>
<xml>25. Those who gladly accept the substances offered in charity by</xml>
<xml>a virtuous wealthy person ; and the eternal soul, worthy of attainment, a</xml>
<xml>nice questioner, beauty of the world, who eats the charming food prepared</xml>
<xml>through fire and air ; derive full enjoyment.</xml>
<xml>26. This perishable body made of earth, the home of all organs is</xml>
<xml>created for the enjoyment of the soul. God, for the excellent enjoyment</xml>
<xml>of this active soul, grants this enjoyable object.</xml>
<xml>27. Thoughtful persons strengthen this excellent embodied soul,</xml>
<xml>at times in three different stages,</xml>
<xml>Soul enters this body, the foremost part of the Earth, for doing noble</xml>
<xml>deeds for the sake of spiritual enjoyment.</xml>
<xml>28. Invoker, atoner, fire-kindler, bringer of rain, sage, scholar-</xml>
<xml>encircled, thou ministering priest, with this well ordered, well-desired</xml>
<xml>sacrifice, fill full the channels of the rivers.</xml>
<xml>21. Ayu may also mean full age of one hundred years.</xml>
<xml>23. God, soul, matter are by nature eternal and immortal.</xml>
<xml>Other created things are immortal as they are created again and again, and their cause</xml>
<xml>is also immortal. Panch Jana may also mean Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishas, Shudras</xml>
<xml>and Nishadas the barbarians. Panch Jana may also mean the five elements, air, water, fire,</xml>
<xml>earth and Akash (space).</xml>
<xml>26. Enjoyable object : Body.</xml>
<xml>27. Three different stages : Jagr it-waking, swapan-dreaming, sushupti-profound sleep</xml>
<xml>or repose.</xml>
<xml>28. Through yajna, an Adhvaryu the ministering priest gets rain which fills the rivers.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XX V 267</xml>
<xml>29. The hewers of the yajna's post and those who carry it, and</xml>
<xml>those who carve the knob to deck the horse's stake ; and those who</xml>
<xml>prepare the cooking utensils for the steed and those who strive hard,</xml>
<xml>may their perseverance be attained to by us.</xml>
<xml>30. He, who, competent to afford shelter to all, himself comes to</xml>
<xml>me for my welfare, and who fulfils the desires of the learned, is the source</xml>
<xml>of delight on sight to the learned and sages. May we produce amongst</xml>
<xml>the learned such a strong man, having beautiful brothers.</xml>
<xml>31. Just as the fleet courser is controlled by halter and his feet-</xml>
<xml>ropes, the head stall, the bridle and the cords about him, and the grass is</xml>
<xml>put within his mouth to bait him, so should the learned people control</xml>
<xml>their organs and eat nourishing diet.</xml>
<xml>32. O men, the fly eateth the flesh and blood of a fast-running</xml>
<xml>horse. The vedic utterances in a yajna are like thunderbolts, part of the</xml>
<xml>oblation adhereth to the sacrificer's hands and nails. May all this be</xml>
<xml>with ye and the learned,</xml>
<xml>33. Food undigested that comes out of the belly, and the bad</xml>
<xml>odour rising from the raw half-cooked food should be removed by skilled</xml>
<xml>cooks. Let the digestive powers of ours digest the nice well-cooked food.</xml>
<xml>34. Whatever word of quick wisdom, comes with certainty and</xml>
<xml>exertion out of thy mouth, seasoned with thy mental fire, waste not that</xml>
<xml>on earth or grass, but give it as instruction to the noble, learned persons.</xml>
<xml>35. They who crave for the meat of a horse, and declare the horse</xml>
<xml>fit to be killed should be exterminated.</xml>
<xml>They who keep the fast horse well trained and disciplined, deserve</xml>
<xml>to be praised by us for the strength of their character and perseverance.</xml>
<xml>36. Realisation of soul-force, that ripens our knowledge, the organs</xml>
<xml>of perception which accomplish our knowledge, the Pranas (vital</xml>
<xml>breaths) which serve as a cloak for our life; the signs of exalted</xml>
<xml>character and the rays of knowledge jointly adorn a strong soul.</xml>
<xml>32. The learned people should keep horses in sheds where flies may not bite them.</xml>
<xml>They should perform yajnas with the loud recitation of vedic verse. Just as the hands and</xml>
<xml>nails of the performer of a yajna are washed with water to clear the particles of oblation so</xml>
<xml>should the horses be washed to remove the dirt sticking to their body.</xml>
<xml>35, Eating the meat of a horse and other animals is prohibited in this verse. They who</xml>
<xml>eat the meat of animals should be exterminated. They who train and make the animals useful</xml>
<xml>deserve praise.</xml>
<xml>36. Organs of perception :-They are five called (9ftf^39) : the skin, tongue, eye. ear and</xml>
<xml>nose.</xml>
<xml>268 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>37. O men, just as the intelligent persons accept with favour</xml>
<xml>the beloved, offered, persevering, and consecrated horse, so should ye</xml>
<xml>know them in all respects.</xml>
<xml>Let not the smoke-scented fire make the animal crackle with pain ;</xml>
<xml>nor the glowing caldron-smell break him to pieces.</xml>
<xml>38. The starting, sitting, rolling and fastening of the horse, his</xml>
<xml>drinking and eating, should all be controlled by intelligent keepers.</xml>
<xml>39. The robe they spread upon the horse to clothe him, the upper-</xml>
<xml>covering and the golden trappings ; the halters which restrain the steed,</xml>
<xml>and the heel-ropes, all these are pleasing to the learned.</xml>
<xml>40. If one, when seated, with excessive urging with his heel or with</xml>
<xml>his whip distresses a horse ; all these woes, as with oblation's ladle at</xml>
<xml>sacrifices, with my might I banish.</xml>
<xml>41. O people, just as a horse-breaker, whom the wise befriend,</xml>
<xml>understands the thirty four gaits of a horse, and a veterinary assistant with</xml>
<xml>his knowledge renders his organs free from flaw, and fully examines each</xml>
<xml>and every part of his body , so should ye keep away all maladies powerful</xml>
<xml>like a thunderbolt.</xml>
<xml>42. O people, just as spring alone gives beauty to a graceful horse,</xml>
<xml>or two seasons control him ; so do I control your organs and livelihood, and</xml>
<xml>give you various objects in different seasons, and place all these under the</xml>
<xml>custody of a learned person.</xml>
<xml>43. Let not thy God-loving soul torment thee, as it departs from</xml>
<xml>thy body. Let not the hatchet linger in thy body. Let not a greedy,</xml>
<xml>clumsy immolator, cut unduly with sword thy vulnerable limbs.</xml>
<xml>44. Soul diest not, nor is it injured. Performing noble acts it</xml>
<xml>attains to godhead. May thy powerful Pran and Apan be yoked through</xml>
<xml>Yoga. May a learned person take up the duty of preaching.</xml>
<xml>37. Useful animals like horses should not be killed, nor their meat cooked for eating.</xml>
<xml>They should be protected against fire.</xml>
<xml>38. The verse may also allude to the Brahmcharis (students) whose walking, sitting,</xml>
<xml>lying, eating and drinking should be supervised by their learned preceptors (gurus).</xml>
<xml>39. The verse may also allude to a Brahmchari student at the time of his departure from</xml>
<xml>the Guru,</xml>
<xml>40. One :- A rider.</xml>
<xml>42. Just as horse-breakers train horses according to seasons, so do the preceptors teach</xml>
<xml>the pupils how to behave. Just as air is purified by oblations in fire, so ignorant superstitions</xml>
<xml>are pat in the fire of knowledge, whereby our souls are purified.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XXV 269</xml>
<xml>45. May this learned person bring us all-sustaining riches, wealth</xml>
<xml>in good kine, good horses, and manly offspring. Freedom from sin may</xml>
<xml>Earth vouchsafe us. May this noble soul, the giver of commendable</xml>
<xml>pleasures rule over us.</xml>
<xml>46. Just as the glorious king and all learned persons hold under</xml>
<xml>control these worlds, so should we speedily gain happiness.</xml>
<xml>Just as the Sun with his satellites, and twelve months manifests all</xml>
<xml>worlds, so should a physician helped by other persons give us medicines.</xml>
<xml>May the king with learned persons regulate our sacrifice, our bodies and</xml>
<xml>our progeny.</xml>
<xml>47. O teacher and preacher, with mastery over the vedas, become</xml>
<xml>near us our protectors, welfarers, givers of knowledge and wealth in our</xml>
<xml>homes. Give us wealth most splendidly renowned. Come nigh unto us,</xml>
<xml>so that we may express reverence unto ye.</xml>
<xml>48. O virtuous learned person, grant us knowledge. We pray unto</xml>
<xml>thee for our happiness and the good of our friends. Listen to our call ;</xml>
<xml>and protect us from evil-minded and sinful pesons.</xml>
<xml>46. Sacrifice : Our respect and reverence for learned.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XXVI</xml>
<xml>1. Fire and Earth are favourable to me ; may they be subservient</xml>
<xml>to me in the accomplishment of that aim of mine.</xml>
<xml>Air and firmament are favourable to me ; may they be subservient</xml>
<xml>to me in the accomplishment of that aim of mine. Sun and his light are</xml>
<xml>favourable to me ; may they be subservient to me in the accomplishment</xml>
<xml>of that aim of rain*. Waters and clouds are favourable to me, may they</xml>
<xml>be subservient to me in the accomplishment of that aim of mine. Out of</xml>
<xml>thes3 seven forces are the mainstay of all beings, the eighth is Earth which</xml>
<xml>keeps every one under its sway. O God make all our paths pleasant and</xml>
<xml>comfortable.</xml>
<xml>May I thus obtain true knowledge from these forces.</xml>
<xml>2. I do hereby address this salutary speech for the benefit of</xml>
<xml>humanity, for the Brahmanas, the Kshatriyas, the Shudras, the Vaishas,</xml>
<xml>the kinsfolk and the men of lowest position in society.</xml>
<xml>Dear may I be to the learned and the guerdon-giver in this world.</xml>
<xml>Fulfilled be this desire of mine. May I achieve my aim.</xml>
<xml>3. O God, the guardian of mighty material objects and souls, Thou</xml>
<xml>art realised through the practice of yoga. We accept Thee as the Protector</xml>
<xml>of the vedas, which symbolise Thy authority, and as the Nourisher of</xml>
<xml>selfless scholars.</xml>
<xml>O God, Truth is nobly born of Thee, O God Thou adequately kind-</xml>
<xml>lest in men splendid refulgent mind, laudable wisdom and effectual active</xml>
<xml>mind.</xml>
<xml>Thou existest as a highly resplendent entity through self-force.</xml>
<xml>Grant us marvellous knowledge, riches and fame.</xml>
<xml>1. Fire, air, firmament, sun, water, cloud and sky are seven Sansdis (forces). All</xml>
<xml>beings exist on their support. Bhutaddhni is Earth that keeps under its arms all humao beings.</xml>
<xml>Man should make full use of the forces of nature and fulfil the aim of his life.</xml>
<xml>2. 1 : God.</xml>
<xml>3. Salutary speech : All the four vedas. The vedisare meant for the good of all, high</xml>
<xml>or low. Those who restrict their study to the high castes and deprive the Shudras and the</xml>
<xml>untouchable from reading or hearing them read, disobey the mandate of God and thus commit</xml>
<xml>sin.</xml>
<xml>1 in the second para refers to the kin*.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XXVI 271</xml>
<xml>4. O learned person, possessing vast wisdom and knowledge of the</xml>
<xml>vedas, come here, and drink the juice of medicines ripened by clouds. Thou</xml>
<xml>hast controlled thy senses through yamas and niyamas. We accept thee</xml>
<xml>as the master of worldly kingship and grand supremacy. This is thy home</xml>
<xml>of knowledge. We accept thee as protector of vedic speech, and as full of</xml>
<xml>glory.</xml>
<xml>5. O exalted learned person, full of wisdom and deeds, slayer of foes</xml>
<xml>like the cloud-dispeller sun, come, and drink deep the essence of knowledge</xml>
<xml>produced by the knowers of the vedas. Thou hast controlled thy soul by</xml>
<xml>yogic practices. We accept thee as the master of milk-yielding kine and</xml>
<xml>grand supremacy. This is thy home of knowledge. We accept thee as the</xml>
<xml>master of worldly possessions, and desirous of glory.</xml>
<xml>6. We daily pray for light of knowledge, unto God, the Lord of</xml>
<xml>learning, the Leader of humanity, and the Embodiment of Truth. Thou</xml>
<xml>art realised through yogic practices. I accept Thee as the Leader of</xml>
<xml>humanity. This heart is thy home.</xml>
<xml>I accept Thee as being the Lover of all people.</xml>
<xml>7. Just as the Sun, filled with lustre of grandeur, in the midst of</xml>
<xml>illuminated worlds, gives'us pleasure, and therefore illumnates this world</xml>
<xml>with his light; just as lightning exerts with the Sun, so should we continue</xml>
<xml>in God's grace.</xml>
<xml>O learned person thou art acceptable through beautiful</xml>
<xml>restraints. I respect thee for thy knowledge of electricity. This is thy</xml>
<xml>home. I respect Thee for thy accomplishing electrical projects.</xml>
<xml>8. Just as a learned person foremost amongst the leaders comes for</xml>
<xml>our protection from far away; so should a person brilliant like fire come in</xml>
<xml>a commendable conveyance.</xml>
<xml>We accept thee full of literary thought for a learned person. We</xml>
<xml>accept thee, whose this house is meant for the leader of the learned.</xml>
<xml>9. We pray to him, the master of five senses and lover of five castes,</xml>
<xml>affectionate to all, pure, the knower of the significance of vedic texts,</xml>
<xml>glowing like fire with the warmth of knowledge; the lord of wealth, off-</xml>
<xml>spring and palatial buildings. Thou art imbued with religious laws. I</xml>
<xml>4. Here : In this world.</xml>
<xml>Yamas : Mental restraints. They are five. Ahinsa (Non-violence), Satya (Truth),</xml>
<xml>Asteya (Avoidance of theft). Brahmcharya (celibacy), Aprigraha (Renunciation).</xml>
<xml>Niyamas: sjfa (Purity of body and mind ^q (contentment), ciq (PenanceV,</xml>
<xml>(Religious study) fSTOJf&TUR (Resignation to the will of God).</xml>
<xml>9. Five castes -Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaisha, Shudra and Nishada.</xml>
<xml>272 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>accept thee as a dignified literary person. This is thy home of knowledge.</xml>
<xml>I accept thee as a dignified, literary, religious person,</xml>
<xml>10. May the mighty, thunder-armed, perfectly virtuous king grant</xml>
<xml>us a comfortable home, may he slay the wicked man who hates u?.</xml>
<xml>Thou art equipped with justice and statesmanship. We accept</xml>
<xml>thee for the extreme supremacy. This is thy kingly palace. We accept</xml>
<xml>thee as a paramount sovereign.</xml>
<xml>11. O people, just as cows low to their calves all the day long, so</xml>
<xml>with our songs we glorify for ye, this king, the dispeller of affliction, the</xml>
<xml>checker of assault, and the enjoyer of riches and foodgrains.</xml>
<xml>12. O learned people honour the king who is great and giver of</xml>
<xml>extreme comfort. Like the queen, riches and foodstuffs proceed from the</xml>
<xml>King.</xml>
<xml>13. O wise, learned person, come, here I sing verily other songs to</xml>
<xml>thee. With these praises shalt thou grow strong.</xml>
<xml>14. O learned person, the seasons spread thy yajna, the months</xml>
<xml>protect thy offering. May our year strengthen thy yajna. May thou</xml>
<xml>keep our children safe in every way.</xml>
<xml>15. In the solitude of mountains and confluence of streams a sage</xml>
<xml>develops his spiritual force, contemplating on God through yoga.</xml>
<xml>16. O learned person, I admire thy house, high in altitude, full of</xml>
<xml>foodstuffs, well ventilated and airy, grand in sight and extremely commend-</xml>
<xml>able. May it be durable like the Earth.</xml>
<xml>17. O amiable scholar, fully knowing the duty of service, flow the</xml>
<xml>juice of learning for the king, respectable sacrificer and us mortals.</xml>
<xml>18. God gives instruction for all these graceful glories of men.</xml>
<xml>Willing to serve God, we pray for pleasures.</xml>
<xml>19. May we be prosperous with strong, brave sons, strong kine,</xml>
<xml>strong horses, the strength of all, strong quadrupeds and strong men about</xml>
<xml>us. May the learned guide our sacrifice (yajna) season-wise.</xml>
<xml>20. O teachress bring thou near thee in this domestic life, for</xml>
<xml>drinking the juice of medicines, husbands full of attributes like thee, and</xml>
<xml>consorts of the learned ; and may thy husband invite near him the lustrous</xml>
<xml>scholars.</xml>
<xml>10. Thou -.King.</xml>
<xml>13. Other : Which tbou dost not know or haM not heard before and are new.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XXVI 273</xml>
<xml>21. O eloquent leader, make our fair dealings worthy of praise.</xml>
<xml>Thou art the giver of wealth. Drink the juice of medicines.</xml>
<xml>22. O men, just as the giver of wealth and fame, according to sea-</xml>
<xml>sons, humbly desires to drink the juice, so should ye procure this juice,</xml>
<xml>perform havan, and attain to glory.</xml>
<xml>23. O learned person desirous of supremacy, secure well thy contact</xml>
<xml>with power. In the performance of religious deeds, with a tranquil mind,</xml>
<xml>protect this eternal soul of thine. Sitting steadfastly in this yajna, take</xml>
<xml>into thy belly this efficacious medicinal juice.</xml>
<xml>24. O majestic scholar, serving gladly thy preceptor, in gladsome</xml>
<xml>company, with the noble qualities, and with thy mother, sister and wife,</xml>
<xml>be happy in the acquisition of nice foodstuffs.</xml>
<xml>Afterwards make others happy like a confortable house, O learned</xml>
<xml>people, well invoked, establish us in fair dealings, sit near us at ease, and</xml>
<xml>give us good instructions.</xml>
<xml>25. O mighty learned fellow, for thee is this juice pressed, for the</xml>
<xml>protection of riches. Purify thyself with its sweetest and most</xml>
<xml>gladdening flow.</xml>
<xml>26. The fiend-queller, and the friend of all, in his country attains</xml>
<xml>to reverence and a dignified position, and lives happily in his house filled</xml>
<xml>with gold.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER xxvti</xml>
<xml>1. O learned person, may years, seasons, knowers of vedic interpre-</xml>
<xml>tation and all the verities strengthen thee.</xml>
<xml>Just as the sun with celestial effulgence illmines all the four effica-</xml>
<xml>cious regions so should thou long for knowledge, and manifest justice.</xml>
<xml>2. Shine thou, O learned person lustrous like fire, make this seeker</xml>
<xml>after knowledge, rise up erect for great and happy fortune. Be those</xml>
<xml>uninjured who adore thee, Let not thy priests, the knowers of all the</xml>
<xml>four vedas, turn against thee. Don't spoil thy glory and progress.</xml>
<xml>3. O learned person, these masters of the vedas elect thee as their</xml>
<xml>leader. Be thou propitious unto them in this election. Remove thou</xml>
<xml>the errors of our foes. O learned person being free from sloth and pride,</xml>
<xml>watch in thy house, and keep us also conscious.</xml>
<xml>4. O learned person, amass wealth in this world. Let not the old,</xml>
<xml>exalted, learned persons, ever devoted to action, tolerate thy moral</xml>
<xml>degradation.</xml>
<xml>O ruler, famous for thy humility, let thy administration be run by</xml>
<xml>just laws. May thy adorers, following non-violence make thee strong.</xml>
<xml>May the State riches make thee happy.</xml>
<xml>5. O learned person commence thy youth with wealth in this world.</xml>
<xml>O king, flowing with the knowledge and humility, exert to maintain</xml>
<xml>friendship with the religious, learned friends.</xml>
<xml>O justice-loving head of the state, act as an umpire in the midst of</xml>
<xml>your coequal virtuous kings. Be renowned as worthy of praise.</xml>
<xml>6. O king, renouncing untruth, suppress fully the wicked persons,</xml>
<xml>overcome spiritual ignorance, and banish miserliness. O learned person,</xml>
<xml>drive away all sins; vouchsafe us opulence with an army of heroic</xml>
<xml>soldiers.</xml>
<xml>7. O king, invincible, full of knowledge, free from misery, reful-</xml>
<xml>gent, and an able administrator, be dear to us in this task of government.</xml>
<xml>Illumine all regions. Chase human ills and griefs with the help of</xml>
<xml>philanthropic persons. Guard us for prosperity.</xml>
<xml>8. O learned fellow, the guardian of big persons, excellent preacher</xml>
<xml>of learning, sharpening the intellect of this king, give him knowledge ;</xml>
<xml>3. Watch in thy house : -Remain slothless doing the household duties,</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XXVII 275</xml>
<xml>instruct him well, instruct thoroughly his subjects. Exalt him to great</xml>
<xml>and high felicity. Let all the learned persons rejoice following his good</xml>
<xml>will.</xml>
<xml>9. O learned fellow, the guardian of big persons, be free from the</xml>
<xml>fruit of sins in the next birth, Chase death far from him who follows the</xml>
<xml>instruments of the religious and law-abiding persons.</xml>

<xml>CHAPTER XXIX 293</xml>
<xml>38. The warrior's look is like the thunderous rain-cloud, when,</xml>
<xml>armed with mail, he seeks the lap of battle. Be thou victorious with</xml>
<xml>unwounded body, and let the strength of thy armour save thee.</xml>
<xml>39. With military weapons let us win the Earth, with them the</xml>
<xml>battle, with cannon let us win the ease-loving army of our foes. War-like</xml>
<xml>weapons destroy the ambitions of the foeman. Armed with the bow may</xml>
<xml>we subdue all regions.</xml>
<xml>40. This bow-string strained on the bow whispers like a woman, and</xml>
<xml>preserves us in the combat, as a wife, fain to speak, offering advic6,</xml>
<xml>embraces her affectionate, praiseworthy husband.</xml>
<xml>41. Just as a learned wife behaves towards her husband, and a</xml>
<xml>mother towards her child} so these two bow-strings, well procured,</xml>
<xml>together beat the foes, and in unison scatter asunder, the foes who hate</xml>
<xml>us.</xml>
<xml>42. With many a son, father of many daughters, he clangs and</xml>
<xml>clashes as he goes to battle, with the quiver slung on the back, the born</xml>
<xml>hero, vanquishes all the scattered armies.</xml>
<xml>43. The skilful driver, sitting in the conveyance, guides his horses</xml>
<xml>in the front, in whichever direction he likes. Just as mind keeps the</xml>
<xml>organs under control, so reins from behind, control the horse. See and</xml>
<xml>admire the strength of these controlling reins,</xml>
<xml>44. Warriors with arms in hand, conveying soldiers swiftly along</xml>
<xml>conveyances, trample upon the foes devoid of friendship, with their</xml>
<xml>forefeet.</xml>
<xml>Fast running horses neigh loudly. Soldiers not burdening their</xml>
<xml>master economically, destroy their foes.</xml>
<xml>45. Let us honour that aeroplane, each day that passes, with</xml>
<xml>hearts full of joy, in which are laid necessary ingredients for propelling it,</xml>
<xml>and gun, cannon, shield, bow, arrow, armour and military equipment of this</xml>
<xml>warrior.</xml>
<xml>46. Let our rulers, be partakers of savoury food, long-lived, patient</xml>
<xml>in adversity, powerful, deep-minded, armed wiih wondrous army, strong</xml>
<xml>in arrows, robust, possessors of long legs and broad chests, invincible, and</xml>
<xml>conquerors of numerous hosts.</xml>
<xml>47. May virtuous people, promoters of truth, protectors, knowers</xml>

<xml>are commanders, adequate transport arrangements, where arrows and</xml>
<xml>weapons are used swiftly like a deer, controlled with cow-leather strings,</xml>
<xml>which pounces upon the enemy forcibly, duly persuaded, and its warriors</xml>
<xml>run together or go hither and thither in different directions.</xml>
<xml>49. O learned person, drive straight away diseases from our body,</xml>
<xml>so that it may be strong like stone. Give us instructions about efficacious</xml>
<xml>medicine and Earth, and grant us happiness.</xml>
<xml>50. O queen, who trainest horses, just as heroes, whip sharply the</xml>
<xml>back of these horses, and lead young soldiers, so shouldst thou drive</xml>
<xml>sagacious chargers in the battles</xml>
<xml>51. May the energetic learned person, discharging arrow from the</xml>
<xml>bow-string, and extirpating the opposing foe from all sides, protect the</xml>
<xml>virile person, in every way, and thundering like a cloud with his armies,</xml>
<xml>acquire all sorts of worldly knowledge.</xml>
<xml>52. O king powerful like the Sun, be our friend, conqueror of foes,</xml>
<xml>yoked with brave, victorious heroes, firm and strong in body.</xml>
<xml>Thou art the possessor of various parts of Earth, make us strong.</xml>
<xml>May thy commander-in-chief win foes deserving defeat.</xml>

<xml>the army, and enjoy all comforts.</xml>

<xml>like speech ; the brown animal is calm and pleasant like the Moon ; the</xml>
<xml>dusky animal is strong in body ; the black-backed animal is fiery like the</xml>
<xml>Sun ; the dappled animal possesses various qualities ; the red animal is</xml>
<xml>full of heat like the Sun ; the black and white coloured animal is fast like</xml>
<xml>the air ; the strong bodied animal possesses the qualities of the Sun and</xml>
<xml>fire ; the bird that flies low is furious like the Sun ; the black coloured</xml>
<xml>bird with one white foot is calm and peaceful like water.</xml>
<xml>59. A red-marked ox is strong and strenuous like the learned</xml>
<xml>commander of the army ; animals with white spots below are active like</xml>
<xml>the Sun ; animals with silvery navel are full of force ; yellow hornless</xml>
<xml>animals are imbued with many qualities ; black and white animal is swift</xml>
<xml>like air ; the black-faced he-goat is ferocious like fire ; the ewe is sweet</xml>
<xml>like speech ; the fast running animal is fast like water.</xml>
<xml>60. To the fiery soul possessing the qualities of Satva, Rajas and</xml>
<xml>Tamas, the crosser of ocean by means of ships, expounded in Gayatri</xml>
<xml>metre, should be offered the food cooked in eight pot-herds. To the</xml>
<xml>highly strong soul, well-versed in fifteen kinds of Trishtup metre, be</xml>
<xml>offered the food cooked in eleven pot-herds. To the divine persons,</xml>
<xml>endowed with diverse qualities, as described in all the seventeenfold Jagati</xml>
<xml>metre, should be offered the food cooked in twelve pot-herds. To Pran</xml>
<xml>and Udan delineated in Anushtup and twentyone fold virat metres, should</xml>

<xml>the same be offered to the entire space protected by the All-pervading</xml>
<xml>God. To the brilliant amongst all men, shining like lightning, be offered</xml>
<xml>the food cooked in twelve pot-herds. For the follower, refined food</xml>
<xml>should be prepared in eight pot-herds.</xml>
<xml>60. The significance of pot-herds and the food prepared therein is not clear to me.</xml>
<xml>According to Pt. Jai Dev, Vidya Alankar. the word ^qic5 (pot-herd) merely denotes division.</xml>
<xml>T means a mature thought well considered by eight learned persons. Similarly</xml>
<xml>mean an idea which is the result of the deliberations of eleven and twelve scholars.</xml>
<xml>Food has been compared to the well thought out idea, resulting from the joint mental cooking</xml>
<xml>of learned persons.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XXX</xml>
<xml>1. O Divine God, create for wealth and supremacy, the king, who</xml>
<xml>is glorious, the protector of the Earth, the purifier of knowledge, the</xml>
<xml>cleanser of our wisdom, the master of speech, who renders our speech</xml>
<xml>sweet, smooth, mild and lovely. Make his rule successful.</xml>
<xml>2. Let us adore the supremacy of that divine God, the Creator of</xml>
<xml>the universe, Self-illumined, and Sublime. We invoke Him to direct</xml>
<xml>our understanding aright.</xml>
<xml>3. O God, full of noble attributes, actions and nature, send far</xml>
<xml>away all vices and calamities, and grant us virtues.</xml>
<xml>4. We praise God, the Procurer of comforts, the Distributor of</xml>
<xml>wondrous wealth, the Creator, and the Seer of men.</xml>
<xml>5. O God create a Brahmana, who knows the veda and God, for</xml>
<xml>propagating the knowledge of God and the veda ; a Kshatriya prince for</xml>
<xml>the safety of kingdom ; a vaisha for rearing the cattle ; a Shudra for hard</xml>
<xml>labour and service. Cast aside the thief, who steals in darkness ; the</xml>
<xml>destroyer of heroes, who passes his days in jail, the eunuch mentally</xml>
<xml>disposed to licentiousness, the dacoit bent on looting and harming people ;</xml>

<xml>duty one who administers justice ; for sweetness a panegyrist ; for</xml>

<xml>Cast aside, a debauchee who indulges in conversation with the</xml>
<xml>dissolute ; a ridiculer fond of derision ; an illegitimate virgin's son,</xml>
<xml>addicted to carelessness.</xml>
<xml>1. Western scholars like Griffith, Colefcrooke, Weber, Wilson, Muir, Oldenberg, and</xml>
<xml>Max Muller consider this and the next chapter meant for human sacrifice. This is an</xml>
<xml>erroneous idea.</xml>
<xml>Just as Ashvamedha does not mean Horse sacrifice, but the Improvement of land for</xml>
<xml>growing more food, so Puru-hmedha does not mean human sacrifice, but the perfection of man</xml>
<xml>for spiritual and worldly advancement. This interpretation put upon these two words by</xml>
<xml>Rishi Dayananda is highly logical and rational. 'Tis pity the western scholars, following</xml>
<xml>Mahidhar and Say ana, have miserably failed to understand the true purport of these words.</xml>
<xml>2. This verse occurs in 335, and 229. It is called Savitri of Gayatri Mantra.</xml>

<xml>of her legal husband.</xml>
<xml>Parivittam : an elder brother who is unmarried, while his younger brother is married,</xml>
<xml>This means that elder brother should be married first. The State should enact a law, that</xml>
<xml>no younger brother be married before his elder brother is married. The words convey</xml>
<xml>condemnation of the elder brother, a prey to lust, who pleads for his marriage.</xml>
<xml>Parivividanam : younger brother who marries before bis elder.</xml>
<xml>Edidhishu-pati : the husband of a younger sister; whose elder sister is unmarried. Such</xml>
<xml>a marriage should ordinarily be prohibited by law.</xml>
<xml>10. A man suffering from eye-disease should not be appointed as a gate-keeper,</xml>
<xml>A blind man should not be appointed as a watchman, otherwise you can't have a sound-</xml>
<xml>sleep, as he cannot protect you against thieves.</xml>
<xml>A deaf man cannot listen to religious preachings, and hence does not know what is truth</xml>

<xml>contagion of their vices.</xml>

<xml>CHAPTER XXXI</xml>
<xml>1. The Almighty God, hath the power of a thousand heads,</xml>
<xml>thousand eyes } a thousand feet.</xml>
<xml>Pervading the Earth on every side He transgresses the universe.</xml>
<xml>2. God, the Lord of final emancipation is in truth the creator</xml>
<xml>of all that hath been and what yet shall be ; and what grows on earth.</xml>
<xml>3. The visible and invisible universe displays His grandeur. Yea,</xml>
<xml>He is greater than this universe.</xml>
<xml>All worlds are but a part of Him, the rest lies in His Immortal,</xml>
<xml>Resplendent Nature.</xml>
<xml>4. God, with three-fourths of His grandeur rises higher than all,</xml>
<xml>separate from the world, enjoying liberation. With one fourth of His</xml>
<xml>grandeur He creates and dissolves the universe again and again. Then</xml>
<xml>pervading the animate and inanimate creation He resides therein. -</xml>
<xml>5. God creates the universe, and lords over it.</xml>
<xml>1. Mr. Griffith translates cl^II^JJrt^ (Dashangulam) as a space of ten fingers, which is</xml>
<xml>meaningless.</xml>
<xml>Thousand means innumerable. Dash Angulam (TRII^Jc&tO the world which is made up</xml>
<xml>of ten parts, i. e. t five gross and five subtle elements. Five gross elements are earth, water,</xml>
<xml>air, fire and atmosphere. Five subtle elements are sight (^) smell (its), speech (3H5)</xml>
<xml>taste (TO), touch (TO!).</xml>
<xml>2. The word (W3) has been wrongly interpreted as food and nourishment.</xml>
<xml>Colebrooke translates the line : 'He is that, which grows by nourishment.' God is not a</xml>
<xml>material object which requires nourishment for growth. He is Everlasting and Immaterial.</xml>
<xml>Muir renders it thus : *He is also the Lord of immortality since by food He expands:'</xml>
<xml>Professors Ludwig and Wilson also give the same explanation.</xml>
<xml>Sayana interprets it thus ; 'He is the Lord or Distributor of immortality because He</xml>
<xml>becomes the visible world in order that living beings may obtain the fruits of their actions</xml>
<xml>and gain moksha or final liberation from their bonds ! This interpretation is highly irrational</xml>
<xml>and illogical. God being immaterial cannot assume a visible form. He is spoken of in the</xml>
<xml>vedas as wi^ without a body. The interpretation of the wastern scholars is mostly based on</xml>
<xml>that o! Sayana.</xml>
<xml>Swami Da yananda interprets ?F3 as Earth, out of which grow all trees, vegetables,</xml>
<xml>and corns.</xml>
<xml>3. God is indivisible. He can't be spoken of as having parts.</xml>
<xml>The words Pad a fourth and Tripad three-fourths are used figuratively to show His</xml>
<xml>immensity and world's littleness.</xml>
<xml>4. What eats is the animate, and what eats not is the inanimate creation*</xml>
<xml>5. The creation of the Earth is mentioned for distinction, though Earth is ordinarily</xml>
<xml>included in the creation of the universe,</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XXXI 303</xml>
<xml>He. then pre-existent, remains aloof from the world, arid</xml>
<xml>afterwards creates the Earth.</xml>
<xml>6. From that great God, adorable by all, were created curd and</xml>
<xml>clairfied butter.</xml>
<xml>He creates the wild and tame animals swift like air.</xml>
<xml>7. From that Adorable God unto Whom people make every kind</xml>
<xml>of sacrifice, were created the Rig Veda. From Him was created the</xml>
<xml>Atharva veda and also the Yajur veda.</xml>
<xml>8. From God were born horses, and from Him were born all cattle</xml>
<xml>with two rows of teeth.</xml>
<xml>From Him were generated kine, from Him were goats and sheep</xml>
<xml>produced.</xml>
<xml>9. O men know Him, the perfect God, existent before the creation</xml>
<xml>of the world, and highly adorable, Him the learned, the yogis and the</xml>
<xml>Rishis realise in the innermost recesses of their hearts, and worship as</xml>
<xml>directed by the vedas preached by him.</xml>
<xml>10. O learned people, ye realise the perfect God in diverse ways :</xml>
<xml>and describe Him in manifold manners. In this creation of God, who is</xml>
<xml>exalted like the mouth ? Who possesses the strength like arms ? Who</xml>
<xml>does the work of thighs ? Who is low like the feet ?</xml>
<xml>11. In God's creation, the Brahmana in body politic is like the head</xml>
<xml>in the body, a Kshatriya is like arms, a Vaisha is like thighs, and a</xml>
<xml>Shudra is considered as feet.</xml>
<xml>6. Wild animals of the forest, like lion, and tame animals of the village like cow, which</xml>
<xml>are quick in motion like the air have been created by God. The word 3TQoZJT^ has been</xml>
<xml>translated by some as bird- of air, but Rishi Dayananda translates it as fast like air.</xml>
<xml>3F*f fj ^QivKJ** 3T?lo 3-8-4-8.</xml>
<xml>According to Shatpath Brahmana ^IQIVXAI^ may also mean food.</xml>
<xml>9. Rishis : men who know the significance of vedic verses.</xml>
<xml>11. Brahmana : one who knows God and the veda, and is their devotee.</xml>
<xml>Kshatriya : He who is warlike in spirit, and defends the country like soldiers.</xml>
<xml>Vaisha : the agriculturist and tradesman, the chief supporter of the society.</xml>
<xml>Shudra : A labourer on whose toil and industry all prosperity ultimately depends.</xml>
<xml>This verse contains reply to the questions raised in the previous verse. The four</xml>
<xml>castes in the society have been compared to the four parts of the body.</xml>
<xml>Commentators like Mahi Dkar and Ubbat translate this verse to mean that a Brahmana</xml>
<xml>is born out of God's mouth, a Kshatriya out of His arms, a vaislu out of His thighs, and a</xml>
<xml>Shudra out of His feet, This interpretation is wrong as God has got no body.</xml>
<xml>304 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>12. The Moon was engendered from His strength of knowledge 5</xml>
<xml>the sun was born from His power of refulgence, the air and ten vital</xml>
<xml>breaths were born from His power of space, fire was born from His power</xml>
<xml>of destruction.</xml>
<xml>13. Mid-air was produced from His central power of space 5 from</xml>
<xml>His excellent head-like strength was fashioned the sky. Earth came into</xml>
<xml>being from His primordial power ; and the quarters from His power of</xml>
<xml>space. Similarly were other regions treated.</xml>
<xml>14. When the learned perform, meditating upon the Adorable</xml>
<xml>God, the sacrifice of mental worship, then morning is its butter, mid-day</xml>
<xml>its fuel, and mid-night its oblation.</xml>
<xml>15. The mental sacrifice, performing which, the learned concentrate</xml>
<xml>upon the knowable God in their hearts, has seven coverings and twenty</xml>
<xml>one kinds of kindling fuel.</xml>
<xml>16. The learned worship God through mental contemplation. Their</xml>
<xml>holy ordinances for the worship of God are immemorial. Such noble</xml>
<xml>souls in particular enjoy the happiness of final beatitude, in which dwell</xml>
<xml>the ancient yogis and learnd devotees.</xml>
<xml>17. God creates in the beginning with His urge this world nourished</xml>
<xml>by waters, earth and sun. Fixing its form, He assigns in the beginning</xml>
<xml>the wisdom and duties of mankind,</xml>
<xml>18. I know this Mighty, Perfect God. who is Refulgent like the Sun</xml>
<xml>and free from ignorance.</xml>
<xml>12. Ten vital breaths : Pranair in the heart, Apan in the anus, Saman in the navel,</xml>
<xml>Udan in the throat, Vyan in the whole body, and Nag, Kurma, Krikal, Dev Dutt, Dhananjaya.</xml>
<xml>14, Sacrifice ' Yajna.</xml>
<xml>Its ; of the Yajna.</xml>
<xml>In the absence of outward provisions a mental sacrifice is to be performed. Then</xml>
<xml>morning, mid-day and mid-night should be imagined to serve the purpose of butter, fuel and</xml>
<xml>oblation of the yajna.</xml>
<xml>15, Seven coverings are the seven metres Chhandas in which the vedic verses encom-</xml>
<xml>pass the yajna.</xml>
<xml>Twenty one kinds of fuel .-Matter, Mahat, Tatva (Intellect), Ahankar (Egotism), five</xml>
<xml>subtle elements (^WR ), five gross elements (^55^cT) five organs of cognition, (fftfeTO) satva,</xml>
<xml>Rajas, Tamsa, three qualites. These twenty one materials serve as fuel to the contemplative</xml>
<xml>yajoa, the learned perform. Griffith says 'This pantheistic hymn, which is generally called</xml>
<xml>the Purushasukta, is of comparatively recent origia Nothing can be farther from truth than</xml>
<xml>this statement. The hymn is the part and parcel of the yajur veda, and is hence as old and</xml>
<xml>immemorial as the Veda itself.</xml>
<xml>16, Holy ordinances : The teachings of the Vedas.</xml>
<xml>18. Knowledge of God alone is the sure path for salvation.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XXXl 305</xml>
<xml>He Only who knows Him feels not the pangs of death. For salva-</xml>
<xml>tion there is no other path save this.</xml>
<xml>19. God, the protector of men, pervades the soul in the womb and</xml>
<xml>the hearts of all. Being unborn, He manifests himself in various ways.</xml>
<xml>Yogis alone realise His true nature. In Him stand all existing worlds.</xml>
<xml>20. The sun gives light and heat to the useful objects like the</xml>
<xml>Earth; stands first and foremost in the centre for the good of all heavenly</xml>
<xml>bodies, is born ere the Earth etc. and being the creation of Gracious God</xml>
<xml>gives us food.</xml>
<xml>21. The learned persons in the beginning, making thee a lovable</xml>
<xml>devotee of God, preach the eternity of God, Soul and Matter. The</xml>
<xml>Brahmana who thus knows the nature of God, shall have learned persons in</xml>
<xml>his control.</xml>
<xml>22. Grandeur and Fortune are Thy two wives :, Thy sides are Day</xml>
<xml>and Night. Constellations are Thy form : the Aswins are Thy open</xml>
<xml>Mouth. Imploring grant salvation unto me, grant me all sorts of knowledge</xml>
<xml>and pleasures.</xml>
<xml>21 Thee ' A devotee of God.</xml>
<xml>22. Thy : God's Aswins . The Sun and Moon.</xml>
<xml>Just as wives serve and protect their husbands, so God protects all through His</xml>
<xml>grandeur and might.</xml>
<xml>Day and Night are two phases of the Sun. When it rises and shines it is day, when it</xml>
<xml>sets it is night. So when God shines in our heart, it is day through His lustre and knowledge. It</xml>
<xml>is night when darknes? (ignorance) prevails in the soul, and we forget God. All luminous</xml>
<xml>objects exhibit the beauty and glory of God, In this Purushiukta the metamorphosic nature of</xml>
<xml>God is spoken of figuratively.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XXXII</xml>
<xml>1. God is Agni being Self-refulgent; He is Aditya as He engulfs</xml>
<xml>all at the time of dissolution of the universe ; He is Vayu as He is All-</xml>
<xml>powerful; He is Chandrama as He is full of pleasure and is the giver of</xml>
<xml>pleasure; He is Shukra as He is pure and quick in action; He is Brahma as</xml>
<xml>He is great; He is Apa being All-pervading j He is Prajapati as He is the</xml>
<xml>guardian of His creatures.</xml>
<xml>2. All divisions of time sprang from the Resplendent, Perfect</xml>
<xml>God. No one hath comprehended Him from above, across; or in the</xml>
<xml>midst.</xml>
<xml>3. There is no image of Him whose glory verily is great. He</xml>
<xml>sustains within Himself all luminous objects like the Sun etc. May</xml>
<xml>He not harm me, this is my prayer. As He is unborn, He deserves our</xml>
<xml>worship.</xml>
<xml>4. O learned persons, this very God pervadeth all regions. He</xml>
<xml>was present in the minds of all in the last cycle of creation; He is</xml>
<xml>present now, and will be present in future cycles. He exists, controlling</xml>
<xml>everything, with His power of facing all directions.</xml>
<xml>5. Before Whom, naught whatever sprang to being; Who with</xml>
<xml>His presence aids all creatures. God, the guardian of His subjects,</xml>
<xml>rejoicing in His offspring, maintains the three great Lustres. He is</xml>
<xml>Shodashi.</xml>
<xml>6. May we realise with love and devotion, God, the Embodiment of</xml>
<xml>happiness; who has made the heavens strong, and the beautiful Earth firm,</xml>
<xml>2. God is indivisible, hath no physical organs, and is ubiquitous</xml>
<xml>3. This verse condemns idol-worship, and incarnation.</xml>
<xml>See Yajur Veda Chapter 25, 'verses 10, 13, 12, 102, and 8-36, 37.</xml>
<xml>4. uWl^H : He without pos< easing the physical organs, does their work.</xml>
<xml>5. Three great Lustres : Lightning, Sun and Moon.</xml>
<xml>Shodashi : Possessing sixteen powers ; as enumerated in the Prashna Upanishad,</xml>
<xml>question sixth.</xml>
<xml>They are : 1. Vital breath, Pran. 2. Faith, Shraddha. 3. Space,</xml>
<xml>Akash. 4. Air 5. Fire 6- Water 7. Earth 8. Sense-</xml>
<xml>organ, Indriya. 9. Mind 10. Grain (corn) 11. Semen, Virya. 12,</xml>
<xml>Austerity, Tapsa. 13. Vedic hymns 14. Moral duty 15. Worlds</xml>
<xml>16. Name,</xml>
<xml>This universe possessing these 16 powers and attributes is created by God and resides</xml>
<xml>in Him who is the master of this universe with sixteenfold attributes and powers.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XXXII 307</xml>
<xml>is full of pleasure, and being free from all miseries is all Bliss and is the</xml>
<xml>Maker of all worlds in the space.</xml>
<xml>7. Whom, the Sun and Earth, the supporters of all, moving in their</xml>
<xml>orbits, worthy of praise for their virtues, affording shelter to humanity, do</xml>
<xml>acknowledge; in Whom the Sun shines in fullj Who shines after manifest-</xml>
<xml>ing great waters and vast space; Whom the teacher and preacher visualise</xml>
<xml>through intellect; may we through concentration realise Him, who is full oi</xml>
<xml>lustre and happiness.</xml>
<xml>8. The sage beholdeth the eternal conscious God hidden in the</xml>
<xml>inmost recesses of the heart ; in Whom this world hath found a solitary</xml>
<xml>abode. In Him is this universe dissolved and then created. He is ubiqui-</xml>
<xml>tous, and pervades souls and matter like warp and woof.</xml>
<xml>9. May the learned person, who knows the vedas, soon expatiate</xml>
<xml>upon the Eternal and Conscious God, the Imperishable abode of salvation,</xml>
<xml>and hidden in intellect. There are three steps of eternal God, placed</xml>
<xml>in comprehension. He who knows them becomes the watchman of God</xml>
<xml>through theism.</xml>
<xml>10. He is our Brother, our Father and Begetter. He knows all</xml>
<xml>beings and all worlds. In Him, the third high stage, the learned obtain-</xml>
<xml>ing the bliss of salvation, move at will.</xml>
<xml>11. God manifests Himself pervading the five elements, the worlds</xml>
<xml>and all the Quarters and Mid-quarters.</xml>
<xml>The learned person having studied the four vedas created in the</xml>
<xml>beginning, unites himself with God the Embodiment of Truth.</xml>
<xml>12. God fully pervading the Heaven and Earth, the worlds, the</xml>
<xml>Quarters, the eternal bliss ; controlling the lengthened thread of Matter,</xml>
<xml>views it, masters it, was its master and will remain so.</xml>
<xml>13. Having worshipped with truthful action and speech, God</xml>
<xml>Wondrous, the lovely Friend of Soul, may I acquire wisdom which dis-</xml>
<xml>criminates between truth and untruth.</xml>
<xml>14. That wisdom which the sages and scholars long for ; with that</xml>
<xml>wisdom, O God, with Thy truthful speech, make me wise today.</xml>
<xml>9. Three steps : Creation, Sustenance and Dissolution of the universe, or present, past</xml>
<xml>and future.</xml>
<xml>The word soon enjoins upon all the knowers of the vedas to lose no time in preaching</xml>
<xml>the vedic truths.</xml>
<xml>10. The third high station : God is higher than matter and soul. Matter is the first,</xml>
<xml>soul the second and God the third stage of man's evolution of knowledge.</xml>
<xml>11. Five elements : Water, air, fire, earth, ether.</xml>
<xml>14. Truthful speech : Knowledge of the vedas.</xml>
<xml>Today : Ever (Tomorrow never comes).</xml>
<xml>308 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>15. May the Supreme God grant me wisdom, in consonance with</xml>
<xml>the performance of religious duty. May the Omniscient God and Pro-</xml>
<xml>tector of man grant me wisdom. May the Omnipotent God grant me</xml>
<xml>wisdom, May the Almighty Father grant me wisdom, May the Ruler of</xml>
<xml>the universe grant me wisdom.</xml>
<xml>16. O God, through Thy grace, leading a life of truth, may these</xml>
<xml>Brahmans and Kshatriyas of my country enjoy the splendour and wealth of</xml>
<xml>my government. Just as the learned persons bestow best splendour and</xml>
<xml>wealth on me, so O seeker after truth may we try for that splendour and</xml>
<xml>wealth for thee.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XXXIII</xml>
<xml>1. In this God's creation, may the fires, ever active, protectors</xml>
<xml>against foes, coupled with fragrant smoke, purifying, white, wealth-</xml>
<xml>producing, ever stirring, recipients of prosperity, seated in woods, rays</xml>
<xml>and water, and potent like winds preserve our houses.</xml>
<xml>2. Various flames of fire, moving in nature, bannered with the</xml>
<xml>smoke, fanned by the wind, rise, aloft to heaven.</xml>
<xml>3. O learned person, honour our friends, revered persons, and</xml>
<xml>scholars. Preach grand truth unto us, and manage thy domestic</xml>
<xml>affairs.</xml>
<xml>4. O learned person, just as a charioteer yokes fast horses highly</xml>
<xml>praised by the experts, so shouldst thou arrange fast burning fires, and</xml>
<xml>verily take thy seat as Hota instructed by the aged sages.</xml>
<xml>5. Just as two women, with fair aim, unlike in semblance, feed</xml>
<xml>themselves, and each in succession nourishes a child in embryo, and one</xml>
<xml>bears a quiet, fascinating babe, and the other an active, fair, shining babe,</xml>
<xml>so do dark and bright night and day exibt, and work for uplift of the</xml>
<xml>world as a child. In one of them is born the peaceful Moon, pleasing to</xml>
<xml>the mind ; and in the other is born the beautiful, purifying and lustrous</xml>
<xml>Sun.</xml>
<xml>6. The explorers, in this world, hold for the people, this fire,</xml>
<xml>vastly expanded, comfort-giving, pariseworthy, investigable in all useful</xml>
<xml>projects.</xml>
<xml>The learned, and the householders with their disciples and children,</xml>
<xml>specially kindle in woods this fire, wondrous in its attributes, actions and</xml>
<xml>nature, spreading to every place.</xml>
<xml>7. The skilled mechanics should utilise fire in making automobiles</xml>
<xml>travel for 3339 miles. Fire and water should be employed in making</xml>
<xml>1. Fires : Electricity and the sacrificial fire.</xml>
<xml>2. Bannered with the smoke : Smoke acts like the flag of fire. Just as a flag from a</xml>
<xml>distance gives us the impression of any army, so smoke seen from a distance gives us the idea</xml>
<xml>of fire. We should utilise these fires for worldly purposes.</xml>
<xml>4. See 1337.</xml>
<xml>6. Fire means electricity.</xml>
<xml>7. Distance of 3339 miles means, the automobiles can be made to travel in a non-stop</xml>
<xml>flight thousands of miles, far and wide.</xml>
<xml>It is not clear why this number of 3339 has been selected to convey the idea of an</xml>
<xml>aeroplane's flight.</xml>
<xml>310 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>them cover the atmosphere. For this fire, the sacrificer should constantly</xml>
<xml>be seated, to perform Havan.</xml>
<xml>8. The learned manifest fire, the head of heaven, resident of Earth,</xml>
<xml>the benefactor of humanity, properly employed in the Yajna, surpassing</xml>
<xml>in the beauty, blazing with lustre, the guest of men, created by the mouth-</xml>
<xml>like power of God for the sake of protection.</xml>
<xml>9. Just as the brilliant, active sun slays the clouds, so should a wise</xml>
<xml>man, aspiring after wealth, remove his vices, having recourse to various</xml>
<xml>devices.</xml>
<xml>10. Just as the sun, with the aid of All-sustaining air, drinks the</xml>
<xml>sweet essence of all medicinal herbs, so should a learned person enjoy the</xml>
<xml>essence of the medicinal herbs of his friend.</xml>
<xml>11. When, for rain, the pure light, coming out of the fire of a</xml>
<xml>yajna full of ghee oblations, reaches the Sun ; he creates in the atmosphere</xml>
<xml>and sends in the form of rain, water, invigorating, pure, youth-infusing,</xml>
<xml>and drinkable.</xml>
<xml>12. Show thyself strong for mighty bliss, O king most excellent be</xml>
<xml>thy effulgent splendours. Strengthen through Brahmcharya the well-</xml>
<xml>knit bond of wife and husband, and trample down the might of those who</xml>
<xml>hate us.</xml>
<xml>13. O learned teacher, as thou payest attention to the weighty words</xml>
<xml>of ours, the Brahmcharis; so we, along with men resplendent like the</xml>
<xml>sun, accept thee deserving of highest reverence.</xml>
<xml>The best men, with strength and wealth, please thee, godly in nature</xml>
<xml>powerful like the sun and bounteous like the air.</xml>
<xml>14. O well read learned person, may the heroes amongst men,</xml>
<xml>self-controllers, wealthy patrons, destroyers of the killers of kine, all these</xml>
<xml>sages, be dear unto thee.</xml>
<xml>15. O supreme ruler, hearer of the grievances of the subjects,</xml>
<xml>listen to the important state business in the company of thy ministers,</xml>
<xml>administrator and learned officials. In this spacious Assembly Hall</xml>
<xml>seat thyself, the impartial friend of all, the Lord worthy of respect,</xml>
<xml>along with officials who resort to their duty early in the morning.</xml>
<xml>8. The head of heaven .- the sun full of fire.</xml>
<xml>The guest of men : Respected by men like a guest.</xml>
<xml>Fire should be used by the learned in propelling automobiles.</xml>
<xml>Just as a powerful and oratorical speech from the mouth instructs men and protects them</xml>
<xml>from dangers, so does electricity protect us.</xml>
<xml>11. He . Sun.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XXXIII 3ll</xml>
<xml>16. O head of the state thou art the wisest amongst all the honour-</xml>
<xml>able learned persons, most adorable amongst all men, responsible for</xml>
<xml>protection, gracious to all, highly renowned for thy knowledge and concen-</xml>
<xml>tration of mind through the practice of yoga.</xml>
<xml>17. May we the state officials, live free from sin, under the shelter</xml>
<xml>of the highly brilliant head of the state, excellent, friendly and worthy of</xml>
<xml>reverence.</xml>
<xml>We crave today for bliss, and gracious favour of the learned, who</xml>
<xml>live under the command of God, as given in the vedas.</xml>
<xml>18. O highly learned parson, thy panegyrists wax like waters,</xml>
<xml>attain to true knowledge like expanding rays. May the persons possess-</xml>
<xml>ing knowledge vast like mind come near us, may thou possess the ^qualities</xml>
<xml>of swiftness and force like air.</xml>
<xml>Thou art worthy of reverence, as thou art highly kind to us through</xml>
<xml>thy wisdom and deeds.</xml>
<xml>19. Just as the cows and sun's rays protect the beautifying Heaven</xml>
<xml>and Earth, so should the learned protect both the ears coupled with golden</xml>
<xml>ornaments, and parts of altar in a yajna.</xml>
<xml>20. May the sinless, affectionate, just, and glorious king, the urger</xml>
<xml>of the laws of administration, improve our health.</xml>
<xml>21. O happiness-giving people, elect him as your ruler, who is</xml>
<xml>most mighty, lends lustre to heaven, and earth, is full of beauty and</xml>
<xml>sustains you.</xml>
<xml>22. O learned people ye all should use in your projects electricity,</xml>
<xml>full of splendour, Self-effulgent, pervading all substances, ever active,</xml>
<xml>present in all indestructible elements, well-established, bringer of rain,</xml>
<xml>killer, and dignified in nature.</xml>
<xml>23. Worship Him, Whose beautiful sacrifice, wealth, strength,</xml>
<xml>and mighty glory are enjoyed by the Heaven and Earth; Who is the</xml>
<xml>16. A person of these qualities should be elected as the head of the State.</xml>
<xml>17. Today : Ever.</xml>
<xml>19. Griffith writes, the meaning of Rapsuda is uncertain. Risbi Dayananda translates</xml>
<xml>the word as givers of beauty. There is no uncertainty in its meaning $TOj f^T* 5^$ l( (Rishi</xml>
<xml>Dayananda 's Commentary). Things which lend beauty.</xml>
<xml>21. He alone is fit to be elected a king, who possesses the characteristics mentioned in</xml>
<xml>the verse, For the translation of (5TSRFT2H I TO to:) See Chapter 7, verses 12, 16.</xml>
<xml>23. Beautiful sacrifice : The great beautiful yajna in the shape of creation.</xml>
<xml>Enjoyed by the Heaven and Earth : Enjoyed by sentient beings and birds, animals and</xml>
<xml>reptiles Dot developed in knowledge living on the earth and in the atmosphere.</xml>
<xml>312 YAjUR VfeDA</xml>
<xml>creator of all beings, the Embodiment of great happiness, All-pervading</xml>
<xml>and Supplier of food.</xml>
<xml>24. They alone perform laudable deeds, whose friend is God,</xml>
<xml>Brilliant, Omnipresent, Majestic, ever young, Exalted, and Supreme,</xml>
<xml>25. O learned person, fit for great veneration, due to thy strength,</xml>
<xml>come and delight thyself with diverse juices of medicinal herbs and food.</xml>
<xml>26. He alone is fit to be elected the head of the State, who</xml>
<xml>possesses power, knows how to arrange his army in different military arrays,</xml>
<xml>is majestic like the sun; challenges for battle his impious foes, chastises the</xml>
<xml>wily and deceitful persons, kills the dacoits hidden in forests, and makes</xml>
<xml>apparent the words of preachers who diffuse happiness.</xml>
<xml>27. O King, the protector of the virtuous, highly venerable, why</xml>
<xml>dost thou go alone ? What is thy purpose in doing so ? Lord of</xml>
<xml>fascinating horses, we are thy well-wishers, consult us in thy true behavi-</xml>
<xml>our and tell us in blissful words, the reason of thy prefering solitude.</xml>
<xml>28. O King, advance those persons who wish to utilise according</xml>
<xml>to their desire, the Earth, which bears at one time many kinds of cereals,</xml>
<xml>is the mother of many sons, the sustainer of numberless human beings,</xml>
<xml>great, and lofty; who wish to kill the wicked, the voluptuous, and harmful</xml>
<xml>persons in the front, and thus extol thy administration.</xml>
<xml>29. O king, I acknowledge this mighty wisdom of thine. My in-</xml>
<xml>tellect manifests thee in praise. The learned on great festive occasions</xml>
<xml>and child-birth bring joy unto thee, the master of intense endurance and</xml>
<xml>the conqueror of foes with thy strength.</xml>
<xml>30. The king, who shining like the wind-urged sun, grants full</xml>
<xml>prolonged life to the sacrifice's lord, in person guards and nourishes the</xml>
<xml>subjects, and variously sheds his lustre, should drink the glorious sweet</xml>
<xml>juice of medicinal herbs.</xml>
<xml>31. O men know ye the illumined sun present in all created objects,</xml>
<xml>whose rays shine wondrously fgr making the world visible.</xml>
<xml>27. A king should do nothing without consulting his ministers. He is a constitutional</xml>
<xml>head. The responsibility of running the state does not devolve upon him alone. It is joint</xml>
<xml>with his advisers and counsellors. See 7-40, 8-2, 3; for translation of the words from JTtf to</xml>
<xml>29. I : Purohit, priest.</xml>
<xml>31. See 7-41.</xml>
<xml>The verse may also mean, just as the rays of the sun exhibit Him, so do the learned</xml>
<xml>display through their knowledge the grandeur of God, knower of all created objects.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XXXIII 313</xml>
<xml>32. O pure king, with that same eye wherewith thou lookest as a</xml>
<xml>guardian, look thou upon us, so that we may follow in thy wake.</xml>
<xml>33. Ye two divine performers of harmless sacrifice, come hither</xml>
<xml>upon a plane with sun-bright exterior, and clearly accomplish your</xml>
<xml>journey, battle, and yajna with agreeable provisions.</xml>
<xml>34. O young preachers, having acquired knowledge through</xml>
<xml>celibacy, just as a learned person, the leader of all, endowed with noble</xml>
<xml>qualities, brilliant like the sun, highly lauded for his speeches on knowable</xml>
<xml>conduct, visits all our sons and cattle } so should ye approach and gladden</xml>
<xml>us, and purify our intellect.</xml>
<xml>35. O slayer of foes like sun, the slayer of clouds, father of supre-</xml>
<xml>macy in knowledge, giver of food, noble man, all things are in thy power</xml>
<xml>today, when wilt thou harness them.</xml>
<xml>36. O king lustrous like the sun, that dispels darkness, is visible</xml>
<xml>to all, produces light and illumines the whole universe, thou illuminest</xml>
<xml>thy state with justice and humility, and art hence worthy of veneration.</xml>
<xml>37. O men, understand the divinity and greatness of God, the soul</xml>
<xml>of the animate and inanimate creation ; Who dissolves in Himself the</xml>
<xml>quarters in the atmosphere, and this vast created universe, and spreads</xml>
<xml>for all darkness like night ; Who again creates the universe with His</xml>
<xml>invisible, divine might.</xml>
<xml>38. God, away from darkness, creates that form of Apan and Udan,</xml>
<xml>whereby the man beholds and perceives.</xml>
<xml>Immeasurable are His Immaculate Nature and power, different from</xml>
<xml>soul, and different from Matter, full of ignorance and darkness, wherein</xml>
<xml>reside the quarters.</xml>
<xml>39. Verily, O God, Thou art great, truly, Indestructible, Omniscient</xml>
<xml>God, thou art great.</xml>
<xml>As Thou art great indeed Thy greatness is admired. Yea, verily</xml>
<xml>Thou , God, art great.</xml>
<xml>40. Yea, God, Thou art great in fame. Thou, evermore, O God,</xml>
<xml>art great. Thou by Thy greatness art the friend of the learned from the</xml>
<xml>33. Sec 7- 12, 16, 42.</xml>
<xml>35. Slayer of foes : King.</xml>
<xml>37. This verse describes the process of the creation and dissolution of the universe by</xml>
<xml>God. Griffith remarks, the stanza is difficult and no thoroughly satisfactory explanation of</xml>
<xml>it has yet been offered, The verse is clear and full of state as inttrprtted by Maaarshi</xml>
<xml>314 VAJtJR VfcDA</xml>
<xml>beginning, the Well-wisher of vital breaths, Unconquerable, Ubiquitous,</xml>
<xml>and Refulgent.</xml>
<xml>41. O people, just as we, manifest all substances depending upon</xml>
<xml>God, Who shines in this world and the world to be, created through His</xml>
<xml>might ; and enjoy the portion allotted to us, so should ye enjoy your share</xml>
<xml>of prosperity.</xml>
<xml>42. O learned persons, save us today from sin and blamable afflic-</xml>
<xml>tion, when the sun hath ascended. May friends, noble persons, atmos-</xml>
<xml>phere, sea, Earth and light all honour our determination.</xml>
<xml>43. The lustrous Sun, with its effulgent and moving nature,</xml>
<xml>revolving repeatedly, bound with the solar system through gravitation,</xml>
<xml>exhibiting all regions, fixing the immortal and mortal in their respective</xml>
<xml>stations, comes and goes at the time of rising and setting.</xml>
<xml>44. The air and Sun, extolled by forefathers, moving nicely,</xml>
<xml>endowed with swiftness, move with intensity for the welfare of human</xml>
<xml>beings.</xml>
<xml>Like the kings in the midst of their subjects, they come and go, and</xml>
<xml>get water at night and morning.</xml>
<xml>45. Electricity, air, Sun, breath, fire, invigorating wealth twelve</xml>

<xml>stand why he holds this view. Its sense is clear and explicit.</xml>
<xml>42. When the sun hath ascended may also mean, when the light of knowledge and</xml>
<xml>wisdom hath dawned upon us. Mitra and Varuna have been translated by some commentators</xml>

<xml>growth, brought daily in use, and relished by our ancestors.</xml>
<xml>60. The divine immortal souls recognise none as their protector,</xml>

<xml>the juice of medicinal herbs.</xml>

<xml>foes, conqueror, vanquish the foes who wish to kill us.</xml>
<xml>67. O King, just as sire and mother walk after the child, so do thy</xml>
<xml>enemies and their territories fall into thy hands. When thou killest</xml>
<xml>thy unjust foe, all his forces are weakened before thy indignation.</xml>
<xml>58. Ye both :-The king and Purohit (priest),</xml>

<xml>all sides, our progeny, riches and home. Master of speech conducive to</xml>
<xml>the welfare of all, keep us for newest bliss; let not the evil-wisher lord</xml>

<xml>them.</xml>

<xml>hither in a sun-bright plane, and explain fully to us the conduct</xml>
<xml>of life.</xml>

<xml>do the Sun and Earth guard this world. Them : The Sun and Earth.</xml>

<xml>fastness in battle it is used as a horse that covers distances quickly. It is</xml>
<xml>helpful for the growth of food grains from the Earth.</xml>
<xml>76. The teacher and preacher are deserving of praise, who like the</xml>
<xml>King and Commander of the army, the bestowers of happiness and</xml>
<xml>chastisers of the irreligious sinners, spread technical knowledge through</xml>
<xml>vedic verses, speech and proclamations.</xml>
<xml>77. May our sons listen about the Immortal God, to the eternal</xml>
<xml>preachings of the vedas from their teachers, and bring us joy.</xml>
<xml>78. Endowed with knowledge and good education, the prosperous,</xml>
<xml>wise persons, expect riches, and desire for vedic instructions from me.</xml>

<xml>79. O Mighty God, Thy nature is matchless. Among the learned</xml>

<xml>knowledge. The pupils should learn from the teachers, from those who are more learned than</xml>
<xml>themselves.</xml>

<xml>spiritual birth, after he has received military training from his teacher, and bocome twice</xml>
<xml>born.</xml>
<xml>81. Material objects, created by God, sing His glory. The learned seeing the wonder-</xml>
<xml>ful, beautiful world created by God, sing the praise of God expressing their admiration for all</xml>

<xml>90. The moon with beautiful gaits, like a loud-neighing horse,</xml>
<xml>runs in the atmosphere, receiving light from the sun. Object of many</xml>
<xml>a man's desire, abundantly golden-hued, she acquires beauty, lustre and</xml>
<xml>grandeur.</xml>

<xml>desired happiness, and each sage for enjoying progress,</xml>
<xml>92. O learned persons, just as the Sun, set in heaven, the bene-</xml>
<xml>factor of humanity, increasing in his power on Earth, ripens medicines</xml>
<xml>84. This verse is the same as 33 -69. The meanings of both are different. Hence</xml>
<xml>there is no repetition. In the verse 69 W^ means, riches and house, whereas here it means,</xml>
<xml>the dependants, which altogether changes the significance.</xml>
<xml>91- Their : the Vishvedevas , the learned sages and saints.</xml>
<xml>Your : the common people, the subjects,</xml>

<xml>by God. Human beings anxious for the fruit of their actions sing the</xml>
<xml>glory of God like their forefathers. Praise ye also Him.</xml>
<xml>93. This verse is applicable to Dawn and Tongue. Rishi Dayananda, Sayana, and</xml>
<xml>Mahidhar have interpreted it differently. I have given the interpretation of Mabtrshi</xml>
<xml>Dayananda. Dawn, without foot moving in the sky, appears when men with feet are sleeping.</xml>
<xml>Birds like cock announce with their tongue its arrival. It leaves its head, the tun. It</xml>
<xml>reappears after passing through thirty divisions of day and night, i.e., 24 hours.</xml>

<xml>which creatures have within them. That without which men can do no</xml>

<xml>worlds, the Conqueror of all, the Object of adoration by all, the awe-</xml>

<xml>Thou our leader in this world.</xml>
<xml>39. O men, Dawns like a disciplined horse, incline us to acquire a</xml>

<xml>ornamentors of the world created, vast, full of diverse objects, filled</xml>
<xml>with sweet water, beautiful in their form, imperishable, rich in seed,</xml>
<xml>stand apart firmly established.</xml>
<xml>46. Let those who are our foemen stand apart from us. With airy</xml>
<xml>and fiery weapons we will drive them off. The Vasus, Rudras, and</xml>
<xml>Adityas have exalted me, made me pre-eminent, mighty, thinker, and</xml>
<xml>sovereign lord.</xml>
<xml>47. O devotees of truth, ye learned persons amongst the officials</xml>

<xml>Bhardwaja, Kashyapa, Gotama, Atri, Vasishtha, Vishwamitra, and Jamadagni, This interpreta-</xml>
<xml>tion is incprrect, as there is no historical reference in the vedas.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XXXIV 327</xml>
<xml>after observing Brahmcharya and completing their studies, who are to-</xml>
<xml>gether advanced in knowledge, who are masters of seven divine forces, are</xml>
<xml>veritable Rishis, the knowers of the vedas. Such calm, wise persons view-</xml>
<xml>ing the path of ancient sages take up the reins of noble deeds like a</xml>
<xml>chariot-driver.</xml>
<xml>50. Bestowing length of life, splendour, increase of wealth, and con-</xml>
<xml>quering power, may this brightly shining gold and food be attached to me</xml>
<xml>for victory.</xml>
<xml>51. The strength acquired by the learned in the Brahmcharya</xml>
<xml>Ashrama, can be destroyed neither by demons nor by fiends. Whoever</xml>
<xml>possesses the strength of celibacy, lives a long life among the sages, and</xml>
<xml>also lives a long life among thoughtful persons.</xml>
<xml>52. Noble persons with benevolent thoughts, full of sagacity and</xml>
<xml>learning, lords of hundreds of soldiers, bind me in knowledge which dis-</xml>
<xml>tinguishes between truth and untruth. I possess that in me for life</xml>
<xml>through hundred autumns, that I may live till ripe old age overtakes me.</xml>
<xml>53. May the unborn God, the Support of all like the atmosphere,</xml>
<xml>Indestructible, the Expander of the world, the Creator of all regions,</xml>
<xml>the Master of permanent knowledge, hear our words. May all the learn-</xml>
<xml>ed persons, the protagonists of truth, vying with each other for advance-</xml>
<xml>ment, and texts recited by the sages protect us.</xml>
<xml>54. I listen with rapt attention to these eternal true sayings of the</xml>
<xml>vedas preached by majestic kings.</xml>
<xml>May associates, intelligentsia, distributors, and noble persons hear</xml>
<xml>our words purifying the conduct like water.</xml>
<xml>55. Seven Rishis are established in the body ; these seven guard</xml>
<xml>it with unceasing care.</xml>
<xml>These seven enter the soul in the body of him who lies asleep. At</xml>
<xml>that time two sleepless gods, the protectors of soul, keep waking.</xml>
<xml>52. Dakshayana 5T8Wn .According to Macdonnel Daks ha is in the veda a creative</xml>
<xml>Power associated with Aditi (Infinity or Eternity), the mother of the Adityas. In past Vedic</xml>
<xml>literature he is generally regarded as the son of Brahma, and placed at the head of Prajapatis</xml>
<xml>or Lords of Created Beings.</xml>
<xml>Rishi Dayananda translates the word as men possessing sagacity and learning. Failure</xml>
<xml>on the part of Western scholars to understand the yaugic, derivative meaning of words leads</xml>
<xml>them to concoct imaginaryjtheories which have no hearin ,n the context and simply confuse</xml>
<xml>the meaning.</xml>
<xml>53. Seven Rishis : Touch, Sight, Hearing, Tate, Smell, Mind and Intellect.</xml>
<xml>Two sleepless gods : Inbreath and out breath, Pran and Apan.</xml>

<xml>longing for learned teachers pray to thee. May those persons who give</xml>
<xml>good gifts, approach thee, and enjoy thou in a righteous manner the</xml>
<xml>gifts offered.</xml>
<xml>57. God, in Whom the Sun, Moon, breaths, air and all good attri-</xml>
<xml>butes, seek their dwelling-place, is verily the Guardian of the vedic lore.</xml>
<xml>He preaches the solemn hymn of praise.</xml>
<xml>58. O God, Protector of the universe, the learned sing Thy praise</xml>
<xml>in the yajna, and we brave people accept Thee as Mighty, be Thou the</xml>
<xml>regulator of this our hymn, instruct the lover of knowledge, and satisfy all</xml>
<xml>virtuous souls.</xml>
<xml>56. Pray to thee : Request tbee to impart knowledge to us.</xml>
<xml>57. Dwelling-place : God is the shelter of all material objects in their nascent and</xml>
<xml>gross condition. All material substances reside in His protection and care.</xml>

<xml>CHAPTER XXXV</xml>
<xml>1. Businessmen who torment others, and are inimical to the learned,</xml>
<xml>should get away from here. May the Beautiful God, grant this soul, the</xml>

<xml>knowledge during all the days and nights of life.</xml>
<xml>2. O soul, God grants for thy bodies in different births, according</xml>
<xml>to thy deeds a happy or unhappy place on this earth. May radiant beams</xml>
<xml>prove helpful to thee.</xml>
<xml>3. O soul, let air purify thee, let God purify thee with lightning's</xml>
<xml>glitter and sun's lustre. Let beams release thee.</xml>
<xml>4. O souls, God has placed ye in this ephemeral world, and made</xml>
<xml>your mansion in this life, ever changing like a leaf. Worship the</xml>

<xml>passions.</xml>

<xml>Him, the protector of men and worthy of worship, near a beautiful place</xml>
<xml>full of water.</xml>
<xml>7. Go hence, O Death, pursue thy special pathway apart from</xml>
<xml>that which the virtuous are won't to tread. To thee that sees and hears,</xml>
<xml>I say, 'Kill not our offspring, injure not our heroes. 1</xml>
<xml>2. After death the subtle soul is carried to different worlds through beams, before it is</xml>
<xml>reborn. On this earth, soul derives happiness or suffering according to his good and bad deeds</xml>
<xml>through the dispensation of God.</xml>
<xml>3. When souls go out after death leaving the bodies, and attain to lightning, sun's lustre</xml>
<xml>and air, and re-enter the womb, at that time the sun's beams, with whose aid the souls roam</xml>
<xml>in the solar system, leave them.</xml>
<xml>4. Ashwatha : The unstable world, which may or may not exist tomorrow, there is</xml>
<xml>no certainty of life. Hence man should worship God, and alienating himself from the unsteady</xml>
<xml>world yoke himself with God for acquiring real happiness.</xml>
<xml>The word WWt has been translated by Griffith as Pig Tree, which is meaningless.</xml>
<xml>See 1279.</xml>

<xml>sub-quarters well for thee.</xml>
<xml>10. On flows this stormy, sensual river-like world, work cautiously,</xml>

<xml>foods.</xml>

<xml>external organs, and evil thoughts.</xml>
<xml>12. To us let waters, and the medicinal plants be friendly, to him</xml>
<xml>who hates us, whom we hate, unfriendly.</xml>
<xml>13. Electricity carries us the learned to distant places. Just as an</xml>
<xml>ox carries the cart, so we use this electricity for prosperity in preparing</xml>
<xml>planes and seating people therein. May that serve as lightning for you.</xml>
<xml>14. May we always keeping in view, eagerly know and realize</xml>
<xml>God, free from the darkness of ignorance. Self-Effulgent, Releaser from</xml>
<xml>afflictions, the most Learned of the learned, the Light that is most</xml>

<xml>and frees it from all shortcomings.</xml>
<xml>12. Hate the sin and not the sinner. We should work for the amelioration and</xml>
<xml>betterment of even the sinner. We should hate the sin of others, who in turn should bate our</xml>
<xml>sin and not us.</xml>
<xml>13. That : Electricity.</xml>
<xml>As lightning : Just as lightning is highly fast in motion, so is electricity.</xml>
<xml>14. See 20 21.</xml>

<xml>away, for them cultivate the land. Let rivulets full of water flow to</xml>
<xml>meet them, and let their truthful wishes be accomplished in a decent</xml>
<xml>manner.</xml>
<xml>21. O wife calm like the Earth, give us far reaching pleasure, as</xml>
<xml>does the Earth, free from thorn, our resting-place. Just as a just</xml>
<xml>ruler drives away our sin, so shouldst thou eradicate our evil.</xml>

<xml>2. Whatever defect I have of eye or heart, or perplexity of mind,</xml>
<xml>that may God amend. Gracious to us be He, Protector of the world.</xml>
<xml>3. Oh men, just as we having studied the science of moral duty, the</xml>
<xml>science of contemplation, and the science of sacred knowledge, meditate</xml>
<xml>upon God, the Reliever of afflictions, inaccessible through physical organs,</xml>
<xml>the Giver of affluence, the Object of desire, the Impeller of our intellects,</xml>
<xml>so should ye do.</xml>
<xml>4. With what help does the ever-prospering, wonderful God become</xml>
<xml>our Friend ? With what constant, most mighty wisdom does He impel us</xml>
<xml>in noble attributes, actions and natures ?</xml>
<xml>5. O man, God, the most advanced in happiness, the Embodiment</xml>

<xml>attend our bipeds and our quadtupeds.</xml>
<xml>.These words have been interpreted by Pt. Jai Dev, Vidya Alankar, as</xml>
<xml>studying the Atharva Veda with attention as one listens with one's ears. This interpretation is</xml>
<xml>plausible as it refers to the four instead of the three vedas.</xml>
<xml>3. See 3-35, 22-9, 30-2.</xml>
<xml>This is Gayatri Mantra. This Mantra occurs four times in the Yajur Veda. Swami</xml>

<xml>times.</xml>

<xml>and pits, the resting place for all durable substances, is comfortable for us,</xml>
<xml>so shouldst thou be. Just as wide Earth gives us place for dwelling, so</xml>
<xml>shouldst thou delight-affording, give us domestic happiness.</xml>

<xml>sustain us for a big famous fight and energy, so should ye endear yourselves</xml>
<xml>to us.</xml>
<xml>15. O noble wives, give us your most propitious affection in this</xml>
<xml>world, like mothers longing for progeny.</xml>
<xml>16. O wives, just as ye make us calm like water, so should we make</xml>

<xml>Yajna Vidhi, May God, the Illuminator of all, Pleasure-giver to all, and All-pervading, for</xml>
<xml>desired happiness and the acquisition of complete joy, be blissful to us. May He shower felicity</xml>

<xml>me, May all beings regard me with the eye of a friend. May I regard all</xml>

<xml>4. O early born, young, brilliant, learned women, I accept ye, this</xml>
<xml>day in a place where the learned assemble, as head of the contemplated</xml>
<xml>sacrifice, connected with the Earth. O lady, the performer of the yajna,</xml>
<xml>I acknowledge thee as head of the yajna.</xml>
<xml>5. O learned person, at first I accept thee for due reverence, for</xml>
<xml>the excellence of association. Thy sacrifice is well-merited. This day, on</xml>

<xml>people lustrous like the Sun. Try hard to avoid sins, expiate for them,</xml>
<xml>and ward off physical ailments through medicine.</xml>
<xml>13. Honour the just ruler. Keep away Death the great Finisher.</xml>
<xml>Worship God the destroyer of the wicked. Contemplate on God the</xml>
<xml>Great. Try for the preservation of vedic knowledge. Revere all learned</xml>
<xml>persons > utilise all the forces of nature. Acquire the knowledge of</xml>
<xml>Heaven and Earth.</xml>
<xml>10. All parts of the body should completely be burnt to ashes.</xml>
<xml>Swaha .I put into the fire an oblation of butter and sacrificial provisions*</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XL</xml>
<xml>1. O man, all moving beings in the universe are enveloped by the</xml>
<xml>Omnipotent God. Enjoy what God hath granted thee. Covet not the</xml>
<xml>wealth of any man.</xml>
<xml>2. Man, only doing unselfish, religious deeds in this world, should</xml>
<xml>wish to live for a hundred years. So Karma cleaveth not to man. No</xml>
<xml>way is there for thee but this for emancipation.</xml>
<xml>3. Verily, the men engulfed in the darkness of ignorance, and</xml>
<xml>those who disobey the dictates of conscience, are sinners given to carnal</xml>
<xml>pleasures. They, in this life, qnd after death, attain to those sexual enjoy-</xml>
<xml>ments enwrapt in affliction and ignorance.</xml>
<xml>4. God is permanent, One, swifter than mind, beyond the reach</xml>
<xml>of physical organs, speeding on before them. He through His Omnipre-</xml>
<xml>sence, outstrips the physical organs running after passions.</xml>
<xml>Residing in Him doth soul perform action.</xml>
<xml>5. God moves in the eyes of fools. He is motionless. He is far</xml>
<xml>distant from the irreligious and ignorant, and near the yogis. He is</xml>
<xml>within this entire universe, and surrounds it externally.</xml>
<xml>6. The man, who sees all animate and inanimate creation in God,</xml>
<xml>and God pervading all material objects, falls not a prey to doubt.</xml>
<xml>7. A man contemplating upDn God, feels in Him all beings like</xml>
<xml>unto himself. Such a yogi looking upon God as an unequalled One, be-</xml>
<xml>comes free from delusion and grief.</xml>
<xml>1. It may also mean enjoy the universe in a spirit of renunciation. One should shun</xml>
<xml>worldly enjoyments to enjoy real spiritual happiness*</xml>
<xml>fa ?OT^ may also mean given to thee by God. Content thyself with what God has</xml>
<xml>given thee.</xml>
<xml>Don't be greedy. To whom do the riches belong ? To none, then why run after money.</xml>
<xml>2. So; Doing noble, religious deeds.</xml>
<xml>No way : For salvation there is no other way, but the performance of good deeds*</xml>
<xml>3. The word Loka has been translated by some commentators as worlds, regions. Swami</xml>
<xml>Dayananda translates it as men who see. There are no regions where pain and ignorance</xml>
<xml>predominate.</xml>
<xml>6. The man he who has renounced the world and wishes for final emancipation. The</xml>
<xml>reading of the Kanva recension is 'na vijugupsate' does not shrink away from them as alien</xml>
<xml>and infer/or to his ownself.</xml>
<xml>348 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>8. God is All pervading, Lustrous, Bodiless, Flawless, Sinewless,</xml>
<xml>Pure, Unpierced by evil. He is Omniscient, Knower of the hearts of all,</xml>
<xml>Censurer of the sinful, and Self-existent. He truly reveals through the</xml>
<xml>vedas all things for His subjects from His immemorial attributes, free</xml>
<xml>from birth and death.</xml>
<xml>9. Abandoning God, deep into the shade of blinding gloom fall the</xml>
<xml>worshippers of eternal, unborn Matter. They sink to darkness deeper</xml>
<xml>yet who are engaged in the material pleasures of the world.</xml>
<xml>10. One fruit, they say, results from the knowledge of this created</xml>
<xml>world, the Effect, another from the knowledge of eternal Matter, the</xml>
<xml>Cause. That from the sages have we heard who have declared this</xml>
<xml>lore to us.</xml>
<xml>11. Tlie man who knows simultaneously the effect and the cause,</xml>
<xml>overcoming death through the knowledge of the cause, attains to salvation</xml>
<xml>through the knowledge of the effect, the created world.</xml>
<xml>12. To blinding darkness go the men who worship Nescience.</xml>
<xml>Those proud of little knowledge enter darkness that is darker still.</xml>
<xml>13. Different is the fruit, they say, of knowledge and Nescience.</xml>
<xml>Thus from the sages have we heard who have declared this lore to us.</xml>
<xml>14. He who simultaneously knoweth well these two, knowledge</xml>
<xml>and Action, overcoming death by Action, by knowledge gaineth salvation.</xml>
<xml>15. O active soul, at the time of death, remember Om, remember</xml>
<xml>God for thy vitality and thy eternity, remember thy deeds. Know that</xml>
<xml>9. They who worship the eternal uncreated matter are spiritually degraded, and are</xml>
<xml>put to suffering. Those who worship and enjoy the material objects of the world are</xml>
<xml>more degraded. God alone is worthy of worship. Asambhuti is undeveloped Prakriti, Nature</xml>
<xml>in its causal or germinal state when it has not been evolved as the universe which is the</xml>
<xml>effect. It is also called tamas, darkness or chaos. This worship is mere blindness, and</xml>
<xml>ignorance.</xml>
<xml>10. Each fruit from the worship of Cause and Effect fail* to achieve the desired object,</xml>
<xml>regarding the integration of soul with the Supreme Self.</xml>
<xml>11. One should know simultaneously the eternal Matter, the cause 91TO of the utti verse,</xml>
<xml>and the effect, TO?, the created world.</xml>
<xml>Sambbuti : The world in which all substances are created.</xml>
<xml>Vinasha :-The eternal matter in which all substances are resolved at the -time of</xml>
<xml>dissolution.</xml>
<xml>Knowledge of Matter 'frees one from the fear of death and the knowledge and practice of</xml>
<xml>noble virtuous 'and religious 'deeds leads one to final beatitude. Ubbat translates Sambhuti</xml>
<xml>as God the Great.</xml>
<xml>12. Nescience :-Worsnip of Matter, not God. Those who with a ' Smattering of</xml>
<xml>knowledge style themselves as highly learned fall iat6 greater darkasss.</xml>
<xml>CHAPTER XL 349</xml>
<xml>soul is immaterial and immortal but the body is finally reduced to ashes.</xml>
<xml>16. O Divine, Lustrous, Benevolent God, most ample, respectful</xml>
<xml>adoration do we bring Thee. Thou art All-Knowing. Remove from us</xml>
<xml>the sin that leads us astray. Lead us through virtuous path to riches,</xml>
<xml>happiness and all sorts of wisdom.</xml>
<xml>17. Omen, by me the Resplendant Protector is covered the face</xml>
<xml>of Eternal Cause, the Matter. The Spirit yonder in the Sun, that spirit</xml>
<xml>dwelling there am I. I am vast like the atmosphere, Greatest of all in</xml>
<xml>merit, action, and nature am I. Om is My name.</xml>
<xml>17, Om is the best name of God. Om comes from the root in (to protect). Gcd is On</xml>
<xml>ai He protects the universe and us all.</xml>
