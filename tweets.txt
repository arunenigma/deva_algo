<xml>Genesis of the Vedas.</xml>
<xml>Vcdas are che Word of God, revealed in the beginning of creation</xml>
<xml>for the moral, spiritual and physical guidance and uplift of humanity.</xml>
<xml>They are replete with eternal truths and throw a flood of light on the</xml>
<xml>various aspects of life to make a man perfect and ideal. God out of His</xml>
<xml>infinite source of knowledge reveals in the beginning of creation a</xml>
<xml>part of it adequate for the requirements of the soul, its spiritual satis-</xml>
<xml>faction, fulfilment of its thirst for truth and making its journey of life</xml>
<xml>God is infinite, the soul is finite. The finite soul cannot contain the</xml>
<xml>infinite knowledge of God, God creates, sustains and dissolves the world.</xml>
<xml>Whenever the world is created God reveals the Vedas. This processes</xml>
<xml>going on since eternity and will go on for ever.</xml>
<xml>Rig Veda Mandal 10, Sukta 90, Mantra 9 ; Yajurveda chapter 31,</xml>
<xml>verse 7 ; Atharva Veda Kand 10, Sutta 7, Mantra 20 speak of the revela-</xml>
<xml>tion of the four Vedas Rig, Yajur, Sama and Atharva.</xml>
<xml>Swami Dayananda,whose commentary I have mainly followed in my</xml>
<xml>translation, has discussed the subject more thoroughly in his Introduction</xml>
<xml>to the translation of the Vedas.</xml>
<xml>Maharshi Patanjali writes in the Mahabhashya, that there are 101</xml>
<xml>Shakhas (schools of thought) of the Yajurveda. All of these commentaries</xml>
<xml>are not available at present except the Kanva, Madhyandini, Taitriya,</xml>
<xml>Maitrayani, Kathak, and Kapishthal. On this point Maharshi Dayananda</xml>
<xml>agrees with Patanjali.</xml>
<xml>/There are 20380 verses in all the four Vedas, as given below :</xml>
<xml>( Rig Veda 10522</xml>
<xml>Yajur Veda 2006</xml>
<xml>Sam Veda 1875</xml>
<xml>Atharva Veda 5977 )</xml>
<xml>There was a time when the learned Pundits memorised one or more</xml>
<xml>Vedas, could recite or reproduce them from memory, but alas this system</xml>
<xml>is no longer in vogue due to lack of public and state patronage.</xml>
<xml>The names of the Rishis attached to the Mantras are the names *6f</xml>
<xml>those research scholars and seers, who expounded the meanings of the</xml>
<xml>2 YAJUR VEDA</xml>
<xml>verses and commented upon them. They are not the authors or writers</xml>
<xml>of those verses as the western scholars say. Devata is the subject matter</xml>
<xml>of a verse, the topic discussed in it. All good men and beneficent forces</xml>
<xml>of nature like air, fire, water, electricity, months, sun, moon, breaths,</xml>
<xml>lightning, father, mother, teacher, preacher, and soul, which are bene-</xml>
<xml>ficial to humanity are called devatas. They are not all living, personified</xml>
<xml>beings as some erroneously believe them to be.</xml>
<xml>( For correct interpretation of the Vedas, the words should be taken</xml>
<xml>in their derivative, analytical sense, i.e., root-meanings should be given</xml>
<xml>to the Vedic words, and not the traditional, customary, conventional, and</xml>
<xml>generally accepted ones. ^ The word gft<? in the conventional sense is</xml>
<xml>faeces, whereas in the Veda it signifies water. The Brahmanas and</xml>
<xml>Upanishadas do not form a part of the Veda. They are compositions of</xml>
<xml>man of a much later date. The Veda contains only the ^ftctt (the real</xml>
<xml>text of the Vedas) as revealed by God in the beginning of Creation on</xml>
<xml>Agni, Vayu, Aditya and Angiras, the four Rishis most competent to</xml>
<xml>receive God's Revelation.</xml>
<xml>' The teachings of the Vedas are universal^ Yajurveda 26-2 clearly</xml>
<xml>enjoins all learned persons to preach the Vedic truths to all, the</xml>
<xml>Brahmanas, the Kshatriyas, the Vaishyas, the Shudras, the Chandalas, the</xml>
<xml>degraded and the forlorn. Dwijas, the twice-born alone are not entitled</xml>
<xml>to study the Vedas. The shudras and even women are equally entitled to</xml>
<xml>read the Vedas. Persons like Kavish Aylush (the seer of R. V. X, 30) a</xml>
<xml>Shudra by birth, vide Aitareya Brahmana 11-19 and women like Lopa</xml>
<xml>Mudra were the seers of the meanings of Vedic texts and their names</xml>
<xml>are from times immemorial attached to the Vedic verses. God is not</xml>
<xml>expected to be partial to one portion of mankind, and antagonistic to the</xml>
<xml>other by depriving them of their birth-right to study the Veda. In the</xml>
<xml>eyes of God all men, high or low, are equally entitled to God's gifts and</xml>
<xml>bounties, say air, water, sunshine and His Knowledge. In the Vedic</xml>
<xml>church none is religiously great or small. All are brothers who should</xml>
<xml>co-operate to conduce to the prosperity and amelioration of mankind.</xml>
<xml>\AccordingtoSwami Bhoomananda Saraswati, the Vedic seer is a</xml>
<xml>poet and prophet but his poetry is not imaginary and his prophecy is not</xml>
<xml>a mystery unless by that term we mean something beyond our compre-</xml>
<xml>hension and not something entirely opposed to the order of Nature?</xml>
<xml>A seer of 'second sight 1 in the spiritist parlance is not a Vedic</xml>
<xml>seer or Rishi. A person who voices out a number of incoherent state-</xml>
<xml>ments void of any clear, rational significance like the "Revelation" of</xml>
<xml>fohn in the New Testament is also no Rishi. fA Vedic seer is the</xml>
<xml>INTRODUCTION 3</xml>
<xml>inspired recipient or medium of Divine Revelation a person who, by bis</xml>
<xml>righteous, pure and holy life is able to grasp higher and Divine things</xml>
<xml>which are far above the Ken of the generality of mankind. Sir Oliver</xml>
<xml>Lodge calls such seers as 'peaks of humanity.' )</xml>
<xml>Aravinda Ghosha on Swami Dayananda and</xml>
<xml>his Vedic interpretation.</xml>
<xml>Among the great company of remarkable figures that will appear</xml>
<xml>to the eye of posterity at the head of the Indian Ranaissance, one stands</xml>
<xml>out by himself with peculiar and solitary distinctness, one unique in his</xml>
<xml>type as he is unique in his work- Such is the impression created on my</xml>
<xml>mind by Dayananda.</xml>
<xml>It was Kathiawar that gave birth to this puissant renovator and</xml>
<xml>new-creator. And something of the very soul and temperament of that</xml>
<xml>particular land entered into his spirit, something of that humanity which</xml>
<xml>seems to be made of the virgin and unspoilt stuff of Nature, fair and</xml>
<xml>robust in body, instinct with a fresh and primal vigour, crude but in</xml>
<xml>a developed nature capable of becoming a great force of genial creation.</xml>
<xml>When I seek to give an account to myself of my sentiment and put</xml>
<xml>into precise form the impression, I have received, I find myself starting</xml>
<xml>from two great characteristics of this man's life and work which mark</xml>
<xml>him off from his contemporaries and compeers. Other great Indians</xml>
<xml>have helped to make India of today by a sort of self-pouring into the</xml>
<xml>psychological material of the race, a spiritual infusion of themselves into</xml>
<xml>the fluent and indeterminate mass which will one day settle into consis-</xml>
<xml>tency and appear as a great formal birth of Nature. One remembers</xml>
